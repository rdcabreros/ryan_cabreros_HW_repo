This is a book about first contact with aliens, written by a prominent member of SETI, the Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence. Sagan makes excellent use of  SETI's current search methods as well as his own  knowledge of astronomy and physics to bring a sense of  reality to the book. But above its literacy, philosophy,  and speculation, it is an entertaining story that is not  overshadowed by gadgetry.	1995-08-30

A society of *EVIL* 'Drow' elves live underground. One elf breaks the mold and fights for what he feels is  right. Beautifully written with increadible fighting scenes.  Intricate plot and so many twists and turns your head'll  spin.        Book #1 in a 9 book series, it actually was the fourth  book written (Crystal Shard was first, from the Icewind   Trilogy) but it is MUCH better if you read the Dark Elf   Trilogy then Icewind Trilogy and then the following 3 books.  #9th book leaves so much unanswered and I don't know if he's  going to continue.

On the surface, first-person story of a young girl's adventures in a small southern town during the depression. Story addresses impact of economic hardship and extreme  racial injustice through the eyes of the heroine without  patronizing her.

Stephen King enters you into the world of  seven children that are bonded by destiny to fight evil itself  in the form of a clown that haunts them and kills other children.    After they thought they had killed IT, 20 something years later, IT  comes back and they are drawn back to their hometown to face  the same evil they faced as children but now they are adults  and actually don't have their innocence and imagination, which  were their advantages over IT.  You'll be hooked until the end  until one of the forces wins, IT or the force that draws the children  (now adults) toghether.	1996-05-22

Goldratt:This story is about marketing and competitive strategy.  Alex Rogo, Mr. Goldratt's fictional hero, has to save three of his companies and hundreds of employees from the chopping block of corporate divestiture by applying logic and persuasive skills. Mr. Goldratt conducts his unique style of logical examination in a field different from that of the \\"The Goal\\", his first and more famous book.  While \\"The Goal\\" says run your production operation for cash, \\"It's Not Luck\\" says the value of a product, or an entire business, is in the eye of the buyer, not the supplier.  A management book without the jargon and trendiness you get elsewhere.	1996-06-09

It is amazing (and embarrassing) how often I saw myself and my co-workers described in this book. The cartoons are excellent as usual. I didn't give this book a 10 because some of the filler was very inane. I was often tempted to skip over the text just to read (and re-read) the cartoons. This book must be in your business library. It says some things about the way we manage (and are managed) in the business setting that cut right to the quick of our personalties.

You'll either love it (I fall into this category), or you'll find it completely unreadable.  There is a plot (of sorts) revolving around the Infinite Jest video (the book's McGuffin), an &quot;entertainment&quot; so completely involving that viewers will starve to death watching it over and over.  However, this is merely the backdrop for a series of stories involving tennis, drug and alcohol recovery, the nature of addiction:  the stories go on and on.<br />The book is VERY long, but  I found myself enthralled by Wallace's storytelling ability - for all of the book's modernist quirks, the good old fashioned storyteller's art saves Infinite Jest time and time again.  As with any book of this length, there are passages the book could probably do without (for my money, a long sequence involving a nuclear war game, Eschaton, would be cut), but I didn't want the book to end.  At 1000+ pages (with footnotes), some of the individual stories are left unresolved, which is perhaps part of the point; I would gladly read a sequel	1996-06-12

This is one of perhaps 8 books that I would give a 10 to<br />and would be my unhesitating answer to the question, &quot;What<br />is the best sci-fi novel of all time?&quot;<br /><br /> Herbert has achieved what very very few sci-fi writers do:<br /> he has created a complex and utterly believable &quot;universe&quot;<br /> that is almost wholly alien to our own. Yet despite this<br /> yawning gulf, Herbert spells nothing out; we learn about the<br /> universe by seeing it through the eyes of the<br /> extraordinarily compelling characters who inhabit it.<br /><br /> This is not an easy read, and it takes more than a single<br /> reading to really appreciate it.

James Clavell submerges you in 16th century Japan where you experience the power struggles,  romance, and even the language.

The  book is essentially a rambling of medival history which often refers back to a certain dynasty.  It is filled with  hundreds of obscure French names which have nothing to do  with anything.  Tuchman jumps from one topic to another,   creating a loose (even non-existant) organization which  leaves the reader lost and confused.  Tuchman seems to   think that her reader already knows the information she  is trying to convey.  It is almost as if Tuchman sat down  at a typewriter and asked herself, &quot;what do I know about  medival European history?&quot; and then wrote whatever came to  her mind, when ever it came to her mind.  With the exception  of the 5th chapter, which details the death and suffering  of millions during the various plagues, the novel is as dry  as sand.  The book's only merit is its informational value,  which if the reader can follow, or for that matter even  stay awake, he may gain something from this book.	1996-07-10

Not since the discovery of Parkinson's Law and the formulation of The Peter Principle has there been anything quite as poignant and timely as the conception of The Dilbert Principle. &quot;The most ineffective workers are systematically moved to the place where they can do the least damage - MANAGEMENT.&quot; That's the essence and message of The Dilbert Principle. With over 250,000 copies in print and a meteoric rise to No. 1 on Business Weeks's hardcover business books best-seller list, this revenge of the cubicle dwellers is a mix of cartoon strips and Scott Adams' succinct observations describing ridiculous company policies and dysfunctional management practices. Not surprisingly, the message is coming in loud and clear in high places. Reengineering guru Michael Hammer has jumped on the Dilbert bandwagon by suggesting that &quot;there is more truth in one volume of Dilbert than there is in 10 volumes of Harvard Business School case studies.&quot; Dilbert pokes fun at organizations where nothing ever really changes except the business buzzwords and corporate slogans. Perhaps that's the secret of the strip's success, both in the U.S. and abroad. &quot;Everybody thinks Dilbert is making fun of somebody else's situation,&quot; suggests Adams, an ex-Pacific Bell cubicle dweller for the past nine years until he was &quot;downsized&quot; recently when his department came under new management. Is &quot;bitter irony&quot; the right phrase? Or perhaps the &quot;system getting even?&quot; In the book's introduction, under the heading &quot;The Evolution of Idiots&quot;, Adams expounds: Theory of Evolution (Summary) First, there were some amoebas. Deviant amoebas adapted better to the environment, thus becoming monkeys. Then came Total Quality Management. I'm leaving out some detail, but the theory itself also has a few holes that are best left unquestioned.

Rated 9 only because I lacked the courage to rate it 10.    If you like to read books you will probably be swept away  by this novel, the first of a thankfully long series by   Patrick O'Brian.    The subjects are the British Navy of the Napoleonic Wars and  two men: Aubrey -- a naval officer and (one quickly assumes)  one of the best sailors who has ever lived and Maturin -- a  physician and &quot;agent extraordinaire&quot; who seems to be  bent  on giving Thomas Jefferson a run for his money as  the man who knows the most of everything that could  be known.    O.K. so you don't like war, sailing, or the early 19th century.  After a few minutes reading this book, you will.  Even lazy  readers (myself for example) will suddenly develop a great  interest in the rigging of three-masted sailing vessels of  the era.      And did I mention, color, romance, and character   development?  A lot of natural science as well.    The publisher offers the whole set of Aubrey/Maturin  novels in hardback for a package price because many  who read the first will be tempted to just buy them  all and avoid any waits in between.  I'm certainly  tempted.	1996-07-16

From the standpoint of a recently undergraduated copywriter in need of a solid vision for the future, Siddharthas trials and eventual spiritual grounding and discovery are meaningful and, at last, comforting revelations that have forced me to examine my own spirituality, materialism, romances, and values.<br /><br />The importance of observing and feeling everything with an open heart and mind while following your own deepest inclinations and directions is the only way to truly determine where you belong, Siddharthas words and actions inform the reader.  From forest to town to river, Siddhartha is welcome and loved for he learns from and gives to all that come to know him.  He gives questions to a spiritual leader and passion to a woman.  He gives success to a business and instruction to a friend.  And finally, Hesses creation gives the reader inspiration and motivation for a closer look at every river along the way to greater self-understanding.<br /><br /> In honesty, when I was first commissioned to read Siddhartha I glanced through the first few pages and put it down for reasons I cannot recall.  Maybe I was too enveloped in the adventures of Henry Chinaski or engaged with the Coma Baby.  I cannot remember.  Anyway, I wish I had read the story then and I am glad I have read it now.	1996-07-23

I just read this book, but I knew it was realeased in 1989. I'm only thirteen, and this was my first Grisham book.  In this story, Grisham hits us with a subject that most might not like to discuss: child rape. Ten-year old Tonya Hailey is brutally raped and almost killed by two drunken rednecks; perhaps the saddest and hardest part to get through with the addition of little Tonya's dream of her father running to get her. After this horrid crime is committed, Tonya's father, Carl Lee exacts vengeance on the two rednecks, and kills them. He is put on trial, and lawyer Jake Brigance is introduced to us. He takes Carl Lee's case and must face his hated enemy, Rufus Buckley, in court. The days leading to the trial are filled with KKK threats, riots between blacks and the KKK, and several other chills and spills. Finally, the trial comes and the small town of Clanton, where the trial is held, is occupated by journalists, soldiers, KKK members, and thousands of blacks, as they all wait for the verdict on the edge of their seats..	1996-07-26

From W.

In his youth, he  was an apprentice to a shipwright. Adams warned Ieyasu about Spain's  and Portugal's desire to propagate Catholocism into Japan, and said that  other nations (England and Holland) were interested only in trade.   Now, for what became of Blackthorne after Toranaga's victory at   Sekigahara... he acquired a large estate in Japan, and married a  Japanese woman. Adams never returned to England. He died in Japan,   laden with honors (presumably from Ieyasu), but still longing for  his homeland. There is a monument to Will Adams in Japan, near the sea.   Ieyasu, possibly because of Adams' influence, expelled the Christain  missionaries a while later: Lord Kiyama (Takayama Ukon) left Japan in  exile to Manila, where he died shortly afterward.

Burgess himself has criticized and attacked this novel which he published in 1968, but which has come to be regarded alongside such dystopian classics as _Brave New World_ and,  perhaps more appropriately, Yevgeny Zamyatin's _We_. An  unsparing story of a sociopathic hoodlum, Alex, _A Clockwork  Orange_ is shocking and often a difficult read despite the  bizarre and sometimes surreal street language employed by  its narrator, a dialect of some archaic words, a few   neologisms, and a great deal of Anglicized Russian. The   film by Stanley Kubrick is equally disturbing, but, as   Burgess himself notes in the introduction to this edition,  leaves off the crucial twenty-first chapter, a chapter that  is vital to the book both for its numerical significance  (twenty-one being considered the age of maturity), and its  philosophical poignance.	1996-08-09

It is not only a poem, as such but a lyrical cry  that echoes  throughout the page and the reader's mind as he/she  lets the words rebound off a boundless  mind/soul.  It is as if Ginsberg broke free from   the word-form lines that confine thought and   let his untampered ideas flow free onto the page  and then just leave them there to reform themselves  in the readers mind exactly as Ginsberg thought  them.  He not only cast his un-strained thoughts   onto the page but also poured them into a mind-  breath mould that allowed them to be measured   by each breath the mind takes, re-inhaling the  glorious fumes with the base repitition of &quot;Who...&quot;  This not only gives the poem a measurable quality but  also an ethereal quality because it is not measured  physically but with each breath of the mind.  The second stanza is one of industrial wickedness  and power-hunger as well as divine-right rule and  god-like evil.

The Doorstop's Here   A hellaciously gifted young writer named David Foster Wallace has just written a   huge new novel called ``Infinite Jest,'' and somebody really ought to smack him with it.          It takes a special kind of nerve to write a book with roughly the mass of a medicine   ball, and then end it so unsatisfyingly that the poor reader perversely finds himself wishing   it longer. But Wallace's limp coda only disappoints because the preceding three-and-a-half   inches of ``Infinite Jest'' have succeeded so well at projecting a world of brain-scalding   complexity.     But when is Wallace carefully teasing out a recurrent motif, it's worth   wondering, and when is he just repeating himself? Literally from first page to last, though,   Wallace has given us a meditation on addiction -- the addiction of a tennis prodigy to   organic narcotics, of a paroled second-story man to inorganic ones, of the terrorist to his   cause, the couch potato to mindless pleasures, and ultimately, the unkickable addiction of   readers to all those old storytelling conventions Wallace gleefully blows up like a rotten kid   cherry-bombing an electric train.     The biggest addiction on display here may be Wallace's own, to writing, a habit so   consuming that the only way for him to shake it is with an abrupt, cold-turkey ending.   Luckily, savingly, ``Infinite Jest'' has a second serve to fall back on: its authentically   hysterical, drink-milk-at-your-peril humor.     Here's Wallace doing an overzealous high-school tennis announcer: ``Lamont Chu disembowelled Charles Pospisilova 6-3, 6-2; Peter Beak spread   Ville Dillard on a cracker like some sort of hors d'oeuvre and bit down 6-4, 7-6...while   Gretchen Holt made PW's Tammi Taylor-Bing sorry her parents were ever in the same   room together 6-0, 6-3...''     This is comic overkill of the wettest possible water, the sort of stuff good for   reading aloud to one's more indulgent friends -- ``Wait, just one more'' -- taking care to   leave out expressions like ``SACPOP'' that Wallace doesn't even see fit to explain until 100   pages later, in a slapstick set piece so funny you forgive him immediately. The passage is   also symptomatic of one of Wallace's bad habits, namely, too many characters too quickly   introduced and never adequately differentiated -- not a bad metaphor for the whole high   school experience, but also a hallmark of too many fat books one finds in used-book stores   with their first couple of chapters thoroughly begrimed and the rest in near-mint condition.     ``Infinite Jest'' should find a kinder posterity in just about any near future except the   one where it takes place, sometime early in the next century. Books don't count for much   in Wallace's dystopia, and the only one mentioned is a copy of William James' ``Varieties   of Religious Experience'' long since hollowed out as a stashbox.     Just how early in the next century this is can't be pinned down, as the Gregorian   calendar has long since made way for Subsidized Time, which takes the concept of   commercial sponsorship to its logical terminus by rechristening 2001 or 2020 A.D. or   whatever, as the Year of the Perdue Wonderchicken, the Year of the Depend Adult   Undergarment, &amp;c. Like much else in the book, this tactic is mysterious at first, a scream   when Wallace lets you in on the joke, and kind of a pain by the time he beats it into the   ground. Mercifully, he starts abbreviating the years after a while, then changes his mind   and goes right back to spelling them out.     Approriately for a book about addiction, ``Infinite Jest'' is told largely in flashbacks.   The novel begins with Hal Incandenza, its tennis prodigy antihero, suffering a mysterious   seizure during an Arizona college interview early in the Year of Glad, as in trashbags. We   then backpedal to the rigorously regimented Enfield Tennis Academy near Boston, Hal's   and our home off and on for the bulk of the book. E.T.A is the brainchild of Hal's late   father, J.O., a man of high and wide attainments, last but not least of them artfully cutting a   large hole into the door of a microwave oven, inserting his head, and letting it rip.     J.O.'s place on campus and in Hal's mother's bed has fallen to a shady relation,   giving rise to the suspicion, reinforced by the book's title, that what we've really signed on   for is some hypermodern pastiche of ``Hamlet.'' This holds water as far as it goes, viz.,   until Wallace starts cross-cutting between the Academy and its Enfield neighbor, a   dilapidated halfway house for dipso- and other maniacs. At this point, a fresh scenario   pokes its head out of the verbal thicket -- that ``Hamlet'' is just a red herring, and that   Wallace is really concocting a sort of elephantine variation on ``Entropy,'' Thomas   Pynchon's classic short story of contrasted chaos and regimentation.     Wallace's other novel, ``The Broom of the System,'' has already elicited cries of   ``Pynchonesque!'' from diverse quarters, some of them, to be sure, using the adjective in its   usual sense, i.e., as reviewer's code for ``I didn't finish it,'' others so besotted with Pynchon   that they see his scat everywhere, but a few finding genuine similarities. Both men do share   a head for science, a stomach for gross-out humor, a great ear, and a soft spot for the word   ``maffick,'' but Wallace definitely has the lower opinion of sloth.     This emerges from a third thread in ``Infinite Jest,'' one that pulls it beyond the   realm of homage to either Shakespeare or Pynchon. Hal's father, during his avant-garde   filmmaker phase, has somehow made a movie so enjoyable as to be 100% lethal. All   viewers unfortunate enough to catch even a snippet of this mortally popular production,   which ironically shares its title with the novel, at once live only to see it again and again,   lapsing into a persistent vegetative state from which only drool-drowning will ever deliver   them. All copies have now gone missing, and the post-NAFTA Organization of North   American Nations (O.N.A.N.) is ineptly racing to find them before they can fall into the   Wrong Hands, namely those of a splinter group of legless Quebecois separatists in   wheelchairs.     If this starts to sound a mite daffy, it's also deadly serious. Like ``1984'' and ``A   Clockwork Orange,'' both of which he unmistakably invokes, Wallace's critique of a future   society whose only grail has become the hangoverless bender, the infinite jest -- the   neverending Year of Glad -- rings so true and contemporary it's almost late.     In a way, of course, it is. Everybody from Neil Postman in ``Amusing Ourselves to   Death'' to 10,000 Maniacs in ``Candy Everybody Wants'' has tilled this ground before.   What keeps it fresh is Wallace's prose style, a compulsively footnoted amalgam of   stupendously high-toned vocabulary and giddy low-comedy diction, coupled to a sense of   syntax so elongated that he can seem to go for days without surfacing. At times he appears   determined to end each sentence with a preposition or not at all, with perhaps the slight   edge going to not at all. A Wallace sentence finally draws to a close amid reluctance and   relief, like a hitting streak. Half the time you'll want to pitch the damn book clear into the   next room, with or without benefit of doorway, but the other half you can actually feel   your attention span stretching back out to where it belongs.     Then, contrary to the occasional renegade suspicion, it ends. Little gets resolved,   least of all a reason for Hal's first-chapter seizure, although at least three good guesses   come to mind. Several well-developed characters and one improbably touching romance all   come to naught. Pynchonesque, some will say, but with Pynchon, he's playing with the   whole idea of narrative closure, not thumbing his nose at you for giving a damn.      Finishing ``Infinite Jest,'' one feels less played with thantoyed with. Still, better to   be toyed with by a genius than pandered to by some second-rater who'd write a few   hundred pages and give up. And Wallace has a toybox to do Pandora proud.	1996-08-22

This is (so far, I haven't read Children of the Mind&quot;) the best Ender's Series Book. It is much more indepth and thought-provoking than  Ender's Game, but it doesn't have the same intense flow of  an action book that Ender's Game does. The view the reader  gets of Ender in Ender's Game is only a misleading scratch  in the surface of this caring, human-nature genius. This  book has more originality and drive than Xenocide. Speaker   for the Dead is very different than Ender's Game, it is not  another &quot;war&quot; book, it is a &quot;serious&quot; book, and definitely  worth reader AFTER Ender's Game    the adult Ender.	1996-08-24

Gerald Durrell recounts his childhood in Greece.  His very British, highly eccentric family - and his love of nature - blend in unexpected ways.

Sharing the spotlight are the  fascinating flora and fauna young Gerald stumbles across  on his island.  Even if you thought you couldn't stand   Biology as a student in school, Durrell's descriptions are  so beautifully written, each discovery so exquisitely etched  that you cannot but wonder at the beauty of Nature - and  the amazing gift of prose that Durrell, a naturalist by  profession, brings to this unforgettable book.  It makes you  thirst for more of the same, and happily for us, Durrell has  written several books.. worthy sequels to this tour de   force.	1996-08-24

It is part confession, part narrative, and part meditation on what motivates people-- generally young men-- to make  high risk journeys. Krakauer is at his best when he is  able to suspend rumination, and make the imaginative leap  into the queer, bright, grandiose mind of Chris McCandless,  who starved to death in Alaska after choosing to neglect  almost every common sense measure for wilderness survival.  Krakauer's own autobiographical chapters illuminate his own   long entanglement with risk, but tend to break up the main   story. As with Krakauer's articles in _Outside_ magazine,  I wished for a strong editor, and one good rewrite.	1996-08-26

I was prepared to dislike it--seemed a little too introspective for my tastes (not to mention I usually avoid WWII stories).  What a pleasant, if unsettling, surprise; this book is marvelous.  The writing is sensuous, the characters dramatic, and the setting surreal. The book opens with Hana, the war-fatigued nurse, left behind (by her choice) after the evacuation of the Allies from Italy.  She has seen so much death and so much devastation that she cannot move on with her fellow nurses.  She throws away her uniform and cuts off her hair and settles  in to finish the war in her own way.   Hana is caring for a man she presumes is English, but who is so badly burned that he has no identifying features.  He is an encyclopedia of knowledge of Bedouins and the desert; he quotes from Herodotus frequently, and he has thorough understanding political forces behind the war.  He cannot move but is dependent on Hana to relieve his pain, feed him, and read endlessly to him.  The Italian thief Carravaggio hears tell of the young nurse who refused to leave with the evacuees and realizes she is the daughter of a former friend; he joins her and the patient in the villa, initially out of concern for Hana's well being, and later stays out of compulsion to discover the identity of the patient (which he does).  Incidentally, Carravaggio has had his thumbs cut off for theft and is a morphine addict.  Kip, a Sikh sapper from Lahore, arrives to do his job--finding and defusing Nazi mines and bombs.  He and Hana become romantically involved, but this touchingly described part of the book truly is an incidental part.  Kip is so far from home, so young, and so confused about life that he immerses himself into his treacherous work.  He compares much of his life to his job--what harm can lightening be, when he runs the risk of being blown up several times a day?  He keeps himself isolated from the others as much as he can, to the point of sleeping in atent outside, but like the other characters, he is dependent on the others to find himself.  The story of each character is lovingly told; even the most gruesome vignettes are told with words to wrap yourself in and just roll around.  And although nothing in this book could be classified as too pleasant, the book is immensely satisfying.  I finished it with a modest &quot;Oh, my!&quot;	1996-09-26

Dick's wonderfully satiric look at reality, psychic abilities, and advertising.  The book follows the trials of the members of Glen Runciter's company as they try and figure out who died in a bomb blast.  Things are never as they seem as various members try and understand what happened.  Dick again crafts a truly unique story that is full of wit and discussion on the nature of reality.  He also pokes fun at advertising as the characters search for the mystical substance Ubik- the cure for all of their worries.  Dick manages to keep the reader guessing and involved pretty well.  There are times when things get very confusing, but rest assured all makes sense by the end.  This review, like Ubik, has been informative and safe if read as directed	1996-09-27

Breathtaking, exhilirating, magical - need I go on?	_The Mists of Avalon_ is one of my top five favorite books  of all time.  For me, this has become the true story of the  legend of King Arthur.  It is told through the eyes of all   the women, but mostly through the eyes of Morgaine (Morgan   La Fey), Arthur's half sister.  Other Arthurian stories make   her out to be pure evil.  Here Morgaine presents her point   of view (as well as that of the other major women).  And   what a fine job she does of it.  The story pulls you in and   the pages just fly by.  Bradley draws her characters with   such detail that I felt strongly one way or another about   almost every one of them.

Einstein wrote a book for lay people to explain the  theory of relativity.  I've read it twice, and I still don't know what Albert's talking about.  Ansel Adams wrote   three books on photography, The Camera, The Negative, and  The Print, for lay people to explain how to take   good photographs.  I've read 'em all, and at least  I know what Ansel's talking about, even if I can't take  photographs like his yet (gimme fifty years of practice).  Whether you like Adams' style or not, in technique, he  is to photography what Einstein is to physics: a single  authoritative master who's work can be relied upon.

Seth combines romance with the history, politics  and religion of India to make a very enjoyable glimplse of  life for this young woman and the people around her.

It does not mean being a crybaby, a 90-pound weakling or a scaredy-cat but rather possessing a sensitive nervous system -- an inherited biological trait. This book is about the 15 to 20f us who experience life at one end of the human spectrum. Highly Sensitive People (HSPs) process sensory input more finely and to deeper levels than average.Being aware of subtleties in your surroundings can be a great advantage. It may also mean that stimulating environments can bombard an HSP's system until s/he is exhausted. This trait, like any other, clearly has advantages and disadvantages.Dr. Aron addresses the impact of cultural ideals on the life experiences of HSPs by examining learned coping behaviors, common experiences and the self esteem struggles of those who have been constantly chastised to \\"toughen up.\\" While providing practical advice on crafting a lifestyle that is suited to helping an HSP thrive, this book covers social interaction, career choices, personal health, gender issues and spiritual matters. For those struggling to survive in an aggressive culture that devalues the subtle abilities so central to the nature of an HSP, Dr. Aron has written an thoughtful, helpful, non-judgmental examination of ourselves. Parents, teachers and therapy professionals should also read this book. Don't despair, The Highly Sensitive Person is scheduled to be reprinted in paperback by the end of 1996.	1996-10-09

I think I may have made a tactical error the other day when I told my boss that my career goal was to win the lottery.  But last week I read The Razor's Edge and ever since I've been wondering what made me think that work was so important.  Here's the story:  Larry Darrell is a changed man when he returns to Chicago after serving in World War I.  During the war he witnesses the death of a good friend and comes to the inescapable conclusion that life is too precious to waste.  Armed with this insight, he alarms his friends, family and fiancee when he turns down the plum job and heads to Europe to begin the great adventure of his life.  From the coal mines of southern France to a lama's monastery on a mountain top in Tibet, Larry Darrell steadfastly resists the pressure to succumb to the societal norms of money and career and instead pursues the meaning of life with a single-minded intensity and a touch of grace.  So how are you going to live your life?  Have you had that gnawing feeling lately, as you are working through your 20's and 30's, that you may have unwittingly entered into a Faustian bargain?  Have you ever considered trading in the ordinary for the extraordinary?  These are questions that we all face and ones that are explored with great insight and skill by W. Somerset Maugham in The Razor's Edge.  And with great humor too--not for nothing was it made into a surprisingly good movie starring Bill Murray as Larry Darrell.  So forget about the 12-step programs, the books that tell you how to get along with people you'd rather not get along with and send your inner child to bed.  Check out The Razor's Edge.  Just don't tell your boss what you've been up to.  Oh what the heck, tell the boss.  It would make Larry Darrell smile and who knows, it might make you happy too	1996-10-15

The author was a signals officer in the Pacific Theater of the war and  was captured after the fall of Singapore. He was then sent to  the POW camps involved in the construction of the then Siam-  Burma railway (Remember the &quot;Bridge Over the River Kwai&quot;?).  There he had first-hand experience of the Japanese's brutal  treatment of POWs, himself included. He never forgot the face  of the Japanese interpreter accompanying the soldier who beat  him to a pulp. He narrates how he had to cope psychologically  with normal life after the war, how his wartime experiences  kept on haunting him. Coincidentally, he chances upon some  information regarding a Japanese trying to make reparations  for his wartime brutalities, and indeed confirms that this  was his former tormentor. After a lot of soul-searching, he  finally meets the Japanese in a war memorial beside the Kwai  River bridge, and the process of reconciliation and healing  begins. A very touching story of man's capacity to perhaps  not to forget, but yes, to forgive.	1996-10-18

I am an Australian, I lived in the bush with Aboriginal people when I was a boy. I studied Aboriginal art, history and material culture at University and I now work in a programme devoted to training Aboriginal people. These people are my friends, I know them. <br /> This book reads like one of the 18th century travel novels, i.e Gulliver's Travels etc.. Not in the quality of the written word but in the vagueness of the tale and details. The country that is said to be Australia could be any ex-colonial nation. The people could be native American or African. The details of Aboriginal culture that are thrown in are clinical in a way that makes me think they were copied from the same texts I studied from. <br /> The lack of any place names, store names etc, those little details that mark the quality travel books, is explained away by a need to protect the &quot;real people&quot;. The folk law seems to be a synthasis of many different indiginous cultures I have studied. <br /> What I am getting at is I believe that this book is a misrepresentaion of the Aboriginal people, and is basicaly a money making exersize aimed at the retro hippy market and city dwelling Americans who want to touch something a bit primative and mystical. <br /> It could have been written by anyone who has a fleeting knowledge of Australia and a passing interest in the Aboriginal people and a good reference library. In fact I could have written it myself, and inserted some stories from my Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander friend to spice it up a bit. <br /> If you have to read it, read it as a work of fiction (the library of congress thinks it is). <br /> In conclusion <br />The pro ecology messege is admirable, but the use of the Aboriginal people and the misrepresentation of Australia is deplorable	1996-10-21

I once worked in a thriving bookstore whose primary source of sales came from romance novels.  I mean cheap, tawdry, breath- less stuff with Fabio on the cover; I couldn't bring myself to  read more than two pages without laughing.  It was a shame,  too, because I'm as romantic as the next person.  SO imagine   my shock of delight when I ran across a REAL romance, with  images that resonate as deep as an ocean, written in English  that best represents the state of modern literature.  Canadian  Michael Ondaatje's lyrical and disturbing tale of four wounded  lives at the close of World War II and the memories of loss and  hope that flicker across the pages is a book to be read out loud,  a book that inspires through its sheer force of poetry.  It has  all of the intrigue and wonder of a romance, but without the  guilt; this is a tale of love for adults.  Forget those nice  little novellas about geriatric passion and read passages that  can illuminate corners of your mind, those opinions that scoff   at such silly matters as those of the heart.  Ondaatje won  England's Booker Prize (equivalent to our National Award or  Pulitzer) for his work, and it was well-deserved.  He doesn't  condescend or cheapen emotions to snare an audience, instead  he lets the story unfold in layers until we've come to learn  more about these people: a nurse, a thief, a soldier, and a   terribly disfigured English patient; as if we've lived along  with them.  A stunning, welcome example of the very best moder  fiction has to offer.  And... there's no bare-chested male  models gracing the cover!  &quot;The English Patient,&quot; by Michael  Ondaatje.  Makes a great Xmas gift for the hopeless romantic  in your life.

Open the book and you are plunged into another world, peopled by shattered humans who will rouse you from the complacent present, and draw you inexorably to their world of suffering and (sometimes) redemption. Filled with incredible details, written with grace and knowledge, you cannot help but be caught up in the lives of these mysterious survivors. There is much to learn in these pages, and Ondaatje is a marvelous teacher. The story flows seamlessly along until the last few pages. There it unaccountably falls off track, into an incongruous jeremiad against racism, which contains a vital message, but seems artless and contrived. The ending in no way detracts from the grand achievement of the book, which will linger in your heart for years	1996-11-17

All of the goddess worshippers were   gentle, wise and interesting (unless they became Christians   in which case they became stupid, dull and brutish).    The idea of writing an Arthurian romance from a women's   perspective was a good one, and some of Ms. Bradley's  twisting of the legend was well done, so I haven't given  it the lowest review.

Grishams experience of struggling through law school was so accurate that it brought back a flood of my own memories of school.  Willing to take jobs no matter how sleezy they were.  For anyone who has dealt with an Insurance company, this novel brought back very vivid memories of dealing with the slimmest business in the world.  The struggle and conflict of the main character gave you moments of joy, sadness, fear, and anxiety.  John Grisham had is very best novel, in my mind, until he gave up on the novel to meet a deadline.  Meet a Deadline, is the only excuse I can come up with for the lame ending of this novel.  In the ending, the main character, who would be fine role model for any attorney to acheive, kills a man.  Come on Grisham, you are my favorite author, ask for the book back from the publisher so you can rewrite the ending.

I am honored to be in the presence of students who perhaps for  the first time in their lives &quot;feel&quot; the injustice and prejudice  that far too many prople have been subjected to for numerous  reasons.  I also love the evolving maturity and love in the  unusual Finch family.  I see the family representing many feel  ings that are unspoken in my students' eyes.  Through the eyes   of Scout and out of the mouth of a babe we see and hear about  our educational and judical system.  We see prejudice, love,  family, neighborhood, life, death, mystery, uniqueness, kind  ness, hatred, ignorance, mistrust.  We feel the depth and  breadth of emotion.  It is a story worth telling, reading, dis  cussing more than once.  When Scout says &quot;Heh, Boo.&quot;  She sees  inside of him.  She sees the inner man and looks beyond the   exterior delivering the message to all of us....&quot;Heh, Boo.&quot;&quot;	1996-12-11

My therapist lent me this book to read at a time of crisis in which I had no sense of self-worth. I was suicidal. There were many instances descibed in this book where I found similarities in my emotional make-up although my sufferings were no where near that dramatic and &quot;hopeless&quot;.  In the words of Nietzsche : &quot;He who has a WHY to live for can bear any HOW,&quot; I found peace within chaos.  Although I did not understand some of the more difficult arguments, the book set me on the path to find  my own meaning of life and the courage to live. I think that the meaning of life need not be one thing or   action but can be several but I can only think of one thing now. The meaning of my life now is to  touch the people I know or care about in the most tender and deep way I know how. And to see them happy even  for a brief moment by what I do for them is quite enough. And everyday is a new day and there is opportunity  me to do something positive in my own ways.	1996-12-12

The setting is a hospital in England for those recovering from shell shock. The protagonists are a psychiatrist and his patient who is opposed to the endless slaughter of the war. Clearly to &quot;cure&quot; the patient, to find him sane, is to send him to his probable death.    The entire novel takes place within the hospital yet the horror of this  war is omnipresent, the images sharp and overwhelmingly strong and sad. It is an amazing book because of the author's ability to portray the horror of war without being in the battlefield and the permanent scars left on the psyche.    Interestingly this novel has been built on the foundation of meetings between real people. I found this book irresitible and memorable, and immediately read the rest of the trilogy, but it is this one that is haunting.	1996-12-15

This book started out with the end and then explained why, an effective technique that is well used here.  The plot is about 2 media empires and how they were built: by &quot;monsters&quot;, who did anything to get their way.  By portraying the monsters first as boys growing up, we get to see how they changed and became the powerful figures as adults.  Every scene is related to something that happens later, but because the men are immoral, only one side is presented.  We don't get to see any redeeming qualities of the man who is the worse of two evils, and the man who survives is only too glad to gobble up the empire of the one who fails.  That the two lead characters of the book closely parallel the actual lives of media moguls cannot be overlooked.  The problem is discerning what is fact from fiction.  Since the characters are so overwhelmingly immoral, it detracts from the being able to say &quot;so that's how it was.&quot;  I can understand why Robert Maxwell wanted to stop the book, it can't be all there is to know about him, nor about his competitor.  Overall, this is a minor drawback to a well-paced book about the real world and its power brokers	1996-12-16

Ender's Game is the first (and best) in a series about Ender, a young boy bred to be a leader in a society where more than two children is illegal. An alien race, insect-like possessing a hive mind (sound familiar? see The Madness Season), has attacked Earth, and we live in fear that they may strike again, even though it was decades ago. Ender, a child of the state, is drafted into this war, and he is forced to survive a bitter and difficult life in military school. His sister and brother (his brother Peter seems to be based on a popular killer, who dissected roadkill in his backyard), take over the Earth while he's away at war - an idea that's doesn't sound so silly when you read how they manipulate the internet society. True genius at work, Ender's greatest triumph and worst tragedy make for a powerful ending. Once you're done reading it, put it down and read something else unrelated - the rest of the series doesn't carry as much of a punch.	1996-12-17

Watchers is about a man who has had a horrible  past, Travis Cornell, who thinks that anybody he gets close  to dies. It is also about Nora Devon, a woman who has been  kept isolated from the world by Aunt Violet, a character we  learn to hate. Also in the cast are a superintelligent dog,  a deadly human-made beast, a hitman, a lawyer, and two NSA  agents.  Watchers is by far one of the finest pieces of work ever  printed. Dean Koontz shows us that he is much more than a  horror/suspense writer. While keeping suspense at a maximum,  Koontz tells us a gripping tale about friendship.

Frank McCourt's relentless catalogue of the horrors of his upbringing, while accurate in his case, were not typical of the vast majority of Irish poor of that time.  His family  life was an extreme - his father was an extreme - the death  of three siblings was an extreme.  McCourt does a wonderful  job portraying his mother's courage and in showing the   psychic baggage the Irish Catholic poor are lumbered with.  But this is a mightily flawed book and the acclaim it is  receiving astounds me.  The child's point of view is finally  tedious and wears us down; the pathos is well-worn and   tired; the book lacks any lyricism.  This is a still-born  book and McCourt should try again to give us the book that  all the critics are raving about.	1997-01-04

(Star Trek sucks!) I have read only one of Eddings books, but I have heard he, like Jordan, gets very boring after a just a few books. I have read all of Jordan's books by the way. Goodkind's greatest asset is not his ability to create a universe in which you can completely immerse yourself (like George Lucas' Star Wars), but his ability to draw the reader into the story from page one, and keep the book moving along at an unbelievably fast pace. Jordan and Eddings can only wish they had the same talent. Goodkind is the best author for an intelligent<br />person that is looking for a good series to start his foray into the fantasy genre. Once you have read other authors, Goodkind's greatness is not quite so apparent, but nevertheless, it is still there.<br /><br /> I liked Wizard's First Rule much better,and I even liked The Blood of the Fold a little better.

I have read the other reviews and I agree with all of them.<br />Many aspects of the series have been touched upon by all the<br />reviews. This series is the ONLY set of books that I could<br /> not put down. Like others I interested friends and<br /> co-workers to read the books, even men! through much<br /> assuring that it was NOT a trashy romance despite the<br /> location in the book stores. (Real men can buy a book from<br /> the romance section.) People I encouraged to read the books<br /> told me: they refused to answer the phone, the door,<br /> cut short evenings out (much to their spouses dismay) and<br /> generally ignored the outside world till there were no more<br /> books to read. Best books for anyone sick in bed, that<br /> can't stand convalescing. These books sparked heated debates<br /> on where the characters were going, why they did what they<br /> did, what they TRUELY felt instead of what they said. I had<br /> a friend tell me &quot;Its just a book, calm down&quot; till they read<br /> the series, now they want to know why its taking so long for<br /> the next one. It was agony having to wait for each publication and I envy those people that can go on to the next book<br /> as soon as they shut the cover of the last. Mesmerizing,<br /> enrapting, mind expanding, stimulating to want to know more;<br /> &quot;Ah, there's where Lallybrook would be&quot; while looking at a<br /> map of Scottish Clan territories. As you can tell I cannot<br /> laud these books enough, I would love to see them in movie<br /> format but only if it could be done as well as Interview<br /> with a Vampire, where the movie WAS the book with no poetic<br /> license shortcuts the movie industry loves to make (i.e. see<br /> Steven King). I do have one suggestion for casting, Tim Roth<br /> as Randall, it was deja vu when I saw Rob Roy. But finding a<br /> 6'5&quot;, charismatic, red haired, muscular, beautifully proportioned, handsome actor with enough talent to be able to play<br /> Jamie will be hard to find.	1997-01-07

Yes, if it is Catch-22; in the setting of World War II, Heller depicts the sheer  waste and tragedy for humans, when 'nations' are at war. Catch-22 seeks to show the waste exemplified by the War , without ever depicting a direct attack by the  enemy, the Germans. The protagonist of the book, Yossarian, sees through the sham that war is, and questions  his superiors relentlessly about their ideas of patriotism, when it is he  who is going to die 'for the country'. the novel moves back and forth in time, through  events and from the farcical to the tragic at a machine-gun pace. Yet within this seeming disarray, a  tale builds up- in the end you wonder who the real enemy is - the Germans or Yossarian's superiors	1997-01-07

If you liked Tolkein's Lord of the Rings, get set to enter<br />a world even more engaging! George R. R. Martin has set us upon a journey following<br />the House Stark of Winterfell and their quest of peace for their family in a land<br /> where it is denied them at every turn. I don't know when I've ever read a book as<br /> captivating as this one is. This is the first volume of four (the second, due in the<br /> summer of '97) and as much as I wish all were available right now, the time lag here<br /> will give me time to re-read A Game of Thrones another time or two before the<br /> second is released. If you like to get so wrapped up in a book that you can't wait to<br /> get back home to read some more, this is the one you need to get into. Every time<br /> you think you've figured out what the next turn of fate will bring the members of the<br /> Stark family, George Martin snatches the rug out from under you as you pour into the<br /> next chapter. This is the finest writing I've found in the last two decades!	1997-01-08

Something Wicked is without question the finest piece of contemporary american literature to ever be written.  Starting as a child's tale or fable, the book expands into a mult-layered, multi-complex novel involving death, life and all parts in between. The dynamic tension of freindship, lost loves and puberty  are all dealt with in this amazing piece of work. The premise, a &quot;dark&quot; carnival ariving in a small mid-western town in October is common Bradbury territiry. And there is no doubt of the autobigraphical  nature of this work. As the story weaves itself through the town's population, the two boys at the center of the story, are the only ones that sense the approaching darkness that the carnival brings.   In classic Bradbury prose, the reader is trasported with eloquent descriptions into the story itself. One of the two climaxes of the story, a confrontation between one of the boy's fathers (an aging man  with buckets of regrets and no real hope for the future) and Mr. Dark, the owner of the Carnival is rollercoaster ride of words. In a time where action has displaced writing in novels, this scene is a   delight to anyone who enjoys good literature.     The film adaptation was atrocious, and looked (as Dinsey films do) only at a single element in a multi-faceted story. This film should not be used to judge this book. So don't be put off because of the film.  If you read ANY book this year, make it this one.	1997-01-10

Bill Bryson's travelogue of the United States can be best described as a side-splitter.  Like many of the others who have reviewed this book for Amazon, I found myself reading it out loud to anyone who was close by. A great way to make friends at crowded airports.   This is the tale of Bryson's travels as a young adult with many references to his childhood experiences in Iowa doing such things as traveling on summer vacation with his parents and sister.  While the book has a definite Iowa slant, his experiences are so universal that they will be enjoyed by all. What man has not wondered why the nubile cuties of his youth look as if they had swallowed airmattresses 10 or 15 years later.  Bryson is cynical, jaded, snide and sentimental all at the same time.  A good book for anyone who has traveled to Boston, Washington DC  and particularly good for anyone with Iowa roots.

In doing so, Gabaldon creates a believable and poignant portrait of a marriage that works. Their relationship continues to involve the reader because both Jamie and Claire grow individually within it. This is marriage at its best; offering love, security, and the freedom to be and become.  These books are not romances, nor histories, nor adventure stories.  They are, instead, accounts of one couple's struggle to find themselves through each other in their struggle to establish &quot;a marriage of true minds&quot; under the most unlikely of circumstances.

I have been on bedrest since 9 December and will remain so until mid-March when my second child will be born.  I  anxiously await the arrival of Diana Gabaldon's newest   edition to the saga of Jamie and Clair.  Just over a year ago I   purchased the original three of the series, having great   difficulty due to the fact I'm stationed overseas with the   military.  Upon completing the books my husband unwittingly  sold them in a yard sale and I was so upset I could barely   speak!  My biggest wish was to get the serious again for my  birthday or Christmas.  My Mom sent them to me and I have   not been able to put them down, again.  I have reread these   terrific books.  They are my means of escape.  I love   learning about the Scottish history, and can put myself out   of my bed and into the pages of Mrs. Gabaldon's books.  It   is with exceeding joy I find her fourth book is out and as  I complete the final pages of &quot;Voyager&quot; I await the arrival  of &quot;Drums of Autumn.&quot;  I've never read a book more than once,  and I know I will be reading these over and over in the  year's to come.  I congratulate Mrs. Gabaldon on her zeal  and ability to write.  I only wish I could finish the many  paragraphs and stories I've written.  Her ability to include  so much research is commendable.  It's given me renewed  passion to find out more about my ancestors.  If what other's  have written is true, I expect &quot;Drums of Autumn&quot; to not be the  last, and wait on pins and needles to find out how Jamie and  Clair get back to Scotland ... afterall ... that is where she saw  their grave markers, isn't it?

While reading &quot;The Five Love Languages&quot;, I thought of five couples that could benefit from this knowledge, and several marriages that might have been saved.  Though the author points out that, ultimately, the key to a successful relationship is choosing to love, this book puts it within anyone's power.  I would recommend it to everyone--especially those who are engaged to be married.  Had I known these principles earlier, I could have saved myself and my spouse a lot of heartache.  I feel hopeful about the future and look forward to the rest of my life with my husband	1997-01-20

I collect books, non-fiction and fiction, that have anything to do with it.  I picked up Smith's River God and gave it a try.  I was horribly disappointed.  The storytelling is decent, although there are not enough characters to sustain believability (a pharaoh's entourage was never *that* small!) and the main character, Taita, is just unsufferably smart --he invents everything short of the microwave oven.    The history is atrocious, and that is where the book condemns itself.  Not only are there numerous anachronisms (glass-blowing, shadoufs, etc), but this is the first time I've seen an author not use the rich tapestry of Ancient Egyptian history: this book is about a dynasty that never existed.  Not only are the Hyksos represented as a tidal wave (borne on the innovation of the war chariot), which is nothing like what actually happened, but we see, in the course of the story, an entire city's worth of Egyptians uproot themselves and travel upstream along the Nile to somewhere in Ethiopia and back.  What is unforgivable is that Nubia is shown as uninhabited, a wilderness, whereas in reality it was a vice-royalty of Egypt, nearly as heavily settled (in the Late Period, there even was a Nubian dynasty), that would later give rise to the great civilizations of Meroe and Axum.    When compared to the books by Silverberg (Thebes of the Hundred Gates), Jacq (The Judge of Egypt), Montlaur (Nitocris, Imhotep), Pratchett (Pyramids), Prus (The Pharaoh), Norton (Shadow Hawk), Morris (I, the Sun), Tarr (Lord of the Two Lands), Powers (The Anubis Gates), Saberhagen (Pyramids) and, above all, Gedge (her Scroll of Saqarra is a masterpiece!), this book deserves to be relegated to oblivion.	1997-01-22

It could be argued that deep, involved plots are the surest way to lose your audience.  Certainly, this was what happened whenever I picked up the newest Tolkien release.  Whew, talk about complex!!  But Terry Goodkind changed all that for me.  His subtle intermixing of intense character development, deep emotional suffering, and occasional comic surprises hooked me like no fantasy novel has ever done before.  The main character's persona seems to leap from the page and project itself directly to the &quot;adventure center&quot; of the mind, where it springs to life in a blaze of light and glory.  The relationships in the book were well developed and realistic in a way that I've never seen before.  I found them, and the book, to be a refreshing change from the humdrum worlds wrought by everyday fantasy artists.  Indeed, this latest book in Goodkind's &quot;Sword of Truth&quot; series brings me to a point far from the tears espoused by the title, unless you can count tears of joy	1997-01-23

Elizabeth's younger sisters are silly young girls who favor their senseless mother.  Her father loves her dearly.  He adds humor to the novel with his near-sarcastic views of his family.  The other characters in the novel range from her completely silly and senseless cousin Collins, to the conniving Miss Bingley, to the indescribable Mr. Darcy, Elizabeth's beau.

And after reading &quot;Ender's Lame&quot; I am ready to go back to reading anything else BUT science fiction!  I have never before read a more pretentious and shallow, not to mention silly story than this one about space boy meeting the bee people.  That t.v. show, &quot;Santa Claus Versus the Martians&quot; had more depth than this trash.  The thing that irks me the most about the story is the lack of believability.  OK, I can deal with aliens attacking Earth, the military breeding kiddie war-geniuses, and war games in space.  BUT THE DAMN SIX-YEAR-OLD, ENDER, ACTS LIKE AN ADULT!  Future kid or not, he is nothing like a child, except in size.  He thinks, acts, and talks like an adult.  Card never offers any explanation as to why Ender is like this.  The reader just has to accept it.  Why couldn't Card give some explanation for the way space-boy is, or at least use an adult for the protagonist instead?  The most unbelievable aspect of Ender was his advanced adult social skills.  He knew things NO six-year-old could possibly know, such as one time when he offered his commander a chance to &quot;save face.&quot;  You learn these kinds of skills through experience, and usually far into adulthood.  Question everything you read, readers.  Just because it is science-fiction does not mean it has to be shallow and insulting to your intelligence	1997-01-27

As the first person to publish Emily Dickinson's poems must have felt, surely no writer this good could possibly have gone unpublished!  I have read thousands of novels over the years and maintained my own personal reviews and ratings. My highest rating, five stars, is reserved for true classics that reward unlimited re-readings. Very few books receive that accolade. This is one. &quot;Dunces&quot; is one of the funniest books ever published in the English language, tragicomic in the Rabelaisan, Cervantes sense of the word, but also falling-down-on-the-floor hilarious. Laughed 'til the tears came, and then I couldn't stop weeping. Couldn't stop turning pages, just to see what could possibly happen next.    It is tempting to regret Toole's death, and to wonder if perhaps he would have produced more works of this caliber. In great art, though, quantity seldom equals quality. Toole was a shooting star who captured in &quot;Dunces&quot; his bittersweet understanding of the human condition for the edification of all future generations.	1997-01-30

It was a great feeling of familiarity to open Drums Of Autumn and step once again into the lives of Claire and Jamie.  That they have grown older and matured is quite evident (don't we all though!), but it is nice to see that their love and commitment to each other continues to grow.  The historical aspects of the book were (once again) remarkable and make more of an impression in my mind than any history class ever did. There were parts in the book I had to re-read a few times to actually &quot;get&quot; what had happened - like the people with smallpox being thrown overboard.  And like someone else who reviews the book further down, I wasn't sure what the tomb stone reference was implying.  I am assuming that Frank had the stone placed there, so Jamie does not die in Scotland - as we all thought he must from the previous novels.

If you remeber Chris McCandless, it is probably from the news stories or the widely read Outside magazine piece by this author.  McCandless, if you remeber, was found by moose hunters in an abandoned bus near Mount McKinley in Alaska where had starved to death.  His parents had not heard of him or from him for two years.      At the outset,the author begins a search for explainations of Chirs Mc Candless, his estrangement from family and Society, and his lonely death.  But as he goes on, Krankauer extends his efforts to a type of which McCandless is but a recent represnetative.  As revealed by Krakauer, McCandless is but one a quietly desparate class of wanders, vagabonds and near mystics that inhabit the roads and backwaters of American, a class which he Krakauer also joined early in his life.  Like many a mystic vagabond, Chris was startllingly brilliant and talented.  But he was a young man incapable of accepting the world for the the rather unethical, sub-moral place it is.  But, rather than rush off on a crusade against injustice he precieved, McCandless truned his sights inward.  It is choice of viewpoint that lead to his death.     A subtile mix of visionary, genius and wounded son, Chris is not all that differrent from the people we all meet.  Half way through the book his image began to blur with memories of a highly talented friend who dropped out of Stanford Grad school for a life as a full time &quot;valley climber&quot; in Yosemite.  But what makes the book so chilling is that we never get a definitive answer as to why Chris followed his ultimately fatal route through life.   McCandless' background is not all that horrible, although it is not strewn with roses, either. Yet many others, with far more reason to follow in his footsteps, avoid the downward slope Chris choose and become happy and productive people.       The disturbing, and unanswered question of this book reamins.  Who are the McCandlesses of the future, where are they now and, for we parents, do we have a Chris McCandless under our own roof?	1997-02-03

It's about the struggle Andrew Wiggin faces with his childhood in the future, his talent and how society inevitably tricks him into doing something that will haunt him the rest of his life.  It's a powerful statement about war and society's prejudices.  This is why Ender's Game is one of my favorite novels.

The authors have combed through decades of corporate information to reveal that internal marketing culture and  aligned vision are the fundamental drivers of sustainable corporate growth. If you can convince  directors to take at least a three year perspective - instead of accounting's quarterly ones - in  everything they measure and opinion lead, then their companies are candidates for real wealth  creation. This book's living testimony to the true spirit of marketing leadership is that &quot;visionary&quot;  companies grow eight times more wealth in a generation than average companies. Think of the  difference in future prospects of a nation (Japan?) which invests mainly in visionary  (knowledge-creating) companies and one (UK?) which invests mainly in average (short-termist or  poor learning) companies. And you start to see why every leader - from CEO to national politician  - should be screened for marketing and cultural competence.

Have you ever turned your back and walked out, slamming the door and shouting &quot;Leave me alone!&quot; while secretly hoping your loved one would come after you to reassure you that you're loved, that you're not alone?  Do you remember what it felt like when they never came?  Do you remember the loneliness, the disappointment, the humiliation you felt?  Such experiences are toxic and the more so the earlier in life we have them.  What are we doing to our children by sending them away when we can't handle their feelings?  &quot;Go to your room and don't come out `til you're willing to behave yourself!&quot;  We punish by withholding our love, and the children we raise become fearful, insecure, and clinging, prone to drug addiction and vulnerable to peer pressure.          In order for the child to overcome these fears, he will usually have to be held against some initial resistance.  He may react with anger to the fear of helplessness which the holding will bring up.  Expressing such feelings while being held in a close and loving embrace allows the child to integrate them.  Allowing himself to feel helpless and to accept the safety and protection of his mother's embrace fosters a sense of basic trust.  A person who has had the childhood experience of secure attachment to his mother will not feel that fundamental emptiness and fearfulness inside that drive others into addictions and codependency.    Dr. Welch's book runs counter to society's prevailing attitude that stresses our separateness from each other and welcomes a child's precocity and early independence.  We are so obsessed with the freedom of the individual that we give up on those who isolate themselves out of fear.  There are those who crave the natural high that comes from deep attachments but are so afraid of people that they turn to drugs instead, and all we have for them are shrugs and prisons.    For the sake of our children, I wish Dr. Welch thewidest possible readership	1997-02-09

US	52819332	R152JJ0OBO77IV	0451525884	503057596	Pride and Prejudice: New Edition	Books	5	0	0	N	N	The best source of joy on an island on Valentine's Day.	This book is a fabulous read for anyone interested in almost in aspect of nineteenth century literature.  It encompasses Austen's fabulous use of irony, wonderful examples of females subverting the economic conditions that control them through their wit, and a wonderful contrast in descripitions of landscapes that are prevelent in all of Austen's books.  However, this book stands out as one of the best of the nineteenth century for many reasons.  The first is that Austen's use of irony in this book is readily apparent, especially in the dialogue and actions of the characters.  The wit that Lizzie exudes, especially in her conversations between Mr. Darcy, her unexpected love interest, and the Lady Catherine de Burgh provide endless entertainment for the reader.  The reader develops a line of sympathy for Lizzie as she struggles to make the best of her unfortunate financial situation.  Another reason to love the book not only includes the wit of Lizzie Bennet, but of her father and Mr. Darcy, which provide wonderful view into the superior workings of Austen's mind in terms of her characters' personalities.  The landscapes would provide a wonderful escape for someone stranded on a deserted island because they provide many Romantic countrysides with transcendental descriptions along with wonderful descriptions of London that make the reader feel as if they really are staying with Mrs. Gardner with Jane.  The description of Pemberley alone provides a wonderful example of the grandeur of nineteenth-century estates in England. Since I am supposedly stranded on this island on Valentine's Day, the love story contained within Austen's indirect ocmmentary on the hardships of economics on women in the nineteenth century, provides a hope that each person will meet not only the perfect person, but that person will also recognize them as their destined mate.  This book incorporates the Romantic notions of Byron and Wordsworth into Lizzie, while allowing her to retain pieces of realism that makes her supreme to all of the other female characters.  Austen also provides a wonderful sexual tension between Mr. Darcy and Lizzie that has never been equalled in any book that I have ever read, and being an English major, there have been many.  I have read this book many times and still find motifs, themes, images and nuances in the plot that provide me continually with enjoyment.  For this reason alone would I be content with having this book as my sole company on a deserted island.  The villains in this novel are also so much fun to hate because they prove to be the very foces that try to keep Lizzie and Darcy apart.  The two characters, however, persevere, which would be a very important theme for a person stranded on a desert island.  Perseverence would be the only way  one would survive the lonliness, aside from an excellent book, of course.  Austen was truly ahead of her time as critic after critic will tell you, but only after you have read one of her greatest works will you understand why it has crossed the time and custom boundries and to this day remains a wonderful piece of literature that will continue to provide enjoyment to each new reader that endeavors to read it.

At first, I thought (as many do) that he rushed things at the end to wrap up the story before the page count got too large.  However, after thinking about again I'm no longer so sure about that.  Goodkind makes several references to avalanches - things build and build until finally one small flake is enough to trigger an event all out of proportion to the flake itself.  If one views Stone of Tears in that light, then one might say that the story follows his avalanche model pretty well.  And, like the avalanche, there is always unintended fallout (which makes the next book all the more anticipated).  This is not unlike many crucial points in history.  Overall - good stuff	1997-02-12

The story of Claire and Jamie is compelling, but to be truthful, not as compelling as her first three installments. Something is lacking, and I believe it to be the fact that there is no truly dastardly villain such as Black Jack Randall. Also, one can only suspend belief so far when it comes to imagining life in the North Carolina wilderness in the late eighteenth century. Can we accept that Claire, even for the love of this man who is larger than life, can undertake all the chores, e.g. planting, harvesting, cooking, preserving, doctoring the neighborhood, etc., etc., and still have time and energy for a late night romp under the bushes? Besides, when did she learn to do all this? Her daughter Brianna's tragedy is almost glossed over, unlike the rape of Jamie, which was dwelled on with loving detail in previous books. The trials and tribulations of Roger MacKenzie are almost by the way. My favorite, most fully drawn character in this book is John Grey. He is charming, sympathetic and tragic. I keep seeing David Hyde Pierce of Frasier in the role. While I loved Diana Gabaldon's first three novels, I merely liked this one. Enough to read more, but also hoping for more.	1997-02-13

Later on, he assumes that you have read previous  books.  This book, like others of Terry's are difficult  for Dyslexics to read as most of the jokes are puns and  require a competent reader.  On the whole, a brilliant   book to start the Discworld series on.	1997-02-18

Jason Bourne may be an agent with extra ordinary skills that normally only a robot can have. But you can't tell it simply to your friends.

One of Stephen King's lengthiest books but well worth the read.  Stephen King gets constantly criticized for writing horror and his lack of originality.  But the novel &quot;It&quot; beg's to differ that assumption.  This is a tale of horror, suspense, fantasy, friendship, and most important of all what it feels like to be a child.  A lot of people think that an interest in horror is unhealthy.  They only see the monsters, the evil, the darkness.  What they fail to see is that most of Stephen King's novels are displays of human endurance.  To this day I still have nightmares of Pennywise The Clown.  The fans of Stephen King will always appreciate what he has created: a world of sight, wonder, and amazement	1997-02-19

There are many things I am enjoying about this story line (Over two books so far).  o The main character is a bastard, born from a Prince (King-in-waiting) and a common woman.  I have enjoyed how far the author has taken this in the Kings court.  Where most of the people have looked at him as bastard, leeching from his King, hating him, the King himself has made him a tool which he uses in the background (an assassin), just like the King's half brother.    o The next piece of imagery I like is how the author has portrayed the concept of &quot;being a king's man&quot;.  Where the main character and his father figure have put duty above everything else.  Atypical of how it is usually done, the characters have put there king or prince in the forefront accepting everything he does as what is right.  They are ignorant of how that effects other people like there lovers.    o There are many conflicts which are happening over the story line, but two of the larger ones are coast vs. inland and six duchies vs. outslander	1997-02-24

David Foster Walece's novel Infinite Jest is a story of addiction, but not just drug addiction. Sure, some addicts in this magnificent book are hooked on drugs. One amusing (and disturbing) sequence  is a stream of consciousness rambling by someone who is waiting for a kilo of marijuana to be delivered so he can get high for the last time, but his damaged brain and paranoia keep him from making a decision as to whether he should try to get in touch with his contact. But there are others hooked on sex, sports, old movies, M*A*S*H, radio programs, tennis and even an addiction to breaking an addiction. The story takes place at a tennis academy near Boston in the not too distant future. It just so happens that a halfway house for recovering addicts is just down the hill from the school. Hijinks ensue, but not your typical crazy students vs. the rest of the community a la Animal House. The irony of the situation is that what goes on at the school is, in its own way, identical to what goes on at the halfway house, i.e. folks pushing the edge of the envelope just to see what they can get away with. The author shows us that one can become addicted to just about anything to the point of excluding everyone and anything else from their life. He see it every day: the rituals that people follow and their need for acceptance in a world where their quirks, some physical, some psychological, make them just a little bit different. That's not to say that the book is gloomy and serious. Indeed, it is a satirical look at the future of the country. Years are no longer referred to by a number; they are sold to corporations who subsidize the country in exchange for the free publicity, an idea the former lounge singer President got from attending a New Year's Day Bowl game. People are comparing David Foster Wallace to Thomas Pynchon. I prefer to just let Wallace be Wallace.  Prepare yourself. This is a hefty read. The plot meanders in time and location and some times you wonder &quot; where did that come from?&quot; Fear not, loose ends are tied, often with a surprising knot. Two bookmarkers are necessary: one to mark your place in the text and one to mark your place in the footnotes, a couple of which are chapters unto themselves. Having a PDR and dictionary handy wouldn't hurt, either. And don't stop until you finish it. And when you do, just flip back to page one and start over. After all, if one reading can be this entertaining, just think of the buzz you'll get from two	1997-02-24

The author is getting very rich from sales of this book, while the Aborigines she purports to admire have their wishes ignored.  The local Aborigines deny ever seeing her, and say that she has grossly misrepresented their culture. It is just another form of cultural imperialism dressed up in New Age language.    The author has ignored the wishes of the local Aboriginal people, who have repeatedly asked her to retract her statements. She blithely continues her best-selling run, apparently without a care in the world for her subjects.    I don't agree with censorship, but this would be one book that deserves to be left off the shelves. That amazon.com is *promoting* this book in its Spotlight is a great disappointment to me.	1997-02-25

HAL booted him off into space in 2001) lives again. His frozen corpse is retrieved from beyond Neptune's orbit and he is revived to become a &quot;national treasure&quot; of the third millenium, at least until he finds a more interesting calling as potentially the only person with whom Dave Bowman &amp; HAL (now existing in some form inside the monolith watching over Europa) may communicate and share insights concerning an impending threat to humanity. Most of the book plods along steadily, but without much effect. Entirely plausible, if unexciting, descriptions of the living environments and technologies of the third millenium are intertwined with minimal plot development. The climax of the story is, unfortunately, greatly diminished in impact by its (apparently) entirely coincidental commonalities with ID4.  And, despite the book's title, the door seems to remain ajar just a bit (4001?). Overall: happy ending, no sex, no violence, easy reading, good footnotes.

I've known Krakauer's writing from my 20+ years of reading Outside magazine, and the article on which this book expands -- and his account of the Mt. Everest tragedy -- rank among the best the magazine has offered.  In this book, the author has taken his exhaustive research of Christopher/Alex McCandless' life and retold it with such clarity that one feels a part of the events.  Krakauer also skillfully draws on the lives of other young men -- and, indeed, his own life experiences -- to explore the idealism and sense of adventure and longing for self-discovery that led Chris into the circumstances that led to his death by starvation.  As one who aspired to the kinds of adventures Chris lived out for the final few years of his life -- but never took the bold step of hitting the road in search of them -- I was greatly moved by the telling of this story.  The astonishing honesty and introspection by the writer and the family and friends of Chris McCandless makes this an unforgettable story.  Krakauer was criticized by many Outside readers for &quot;glorifying&quot; the story of Chris McCandless' death in the original magazine article (and he answers these critics' points very effectively over the course of the book), but I think anyone will find this an absorbing, thoughtful, and revealing book.  And for those of us with a bit of Chris' wanderlust and search for freedom in our past (repressed or not), this should rank near the top of the must-read list	1997-02-27

A nice new chapter to the saga, albeit a short one when you  consider a couple chapters are rehashed from earlier books. As a fan it was nice to see the old characters again.    An interesting look at the future but by no means ground breaking.  Mr. Clarke seems to like his early stories a lot to keep revisiting  them (the several Rama books and 2001 sequels).

Genius. <br /> That's a word that we throw around a lot nowadays.  Anybody who reaches the top of their field, comes up with a new and brilliant observation or dramatically changes the way people do things is usually branded a genius.  <br />  Nonsense.  I call it luck and I call it perserverence.  Anybody can become really good at something if they do it their entire life.  The true test of genius comes when somebody becomes an expert as something that they just started working on.  <br />  Richard P. Feynman is one of the most brilliant Physicists of our age--but his book is about almost everything BUT Physics.   Feynman spends a little more than a paragraph discussing his Nobel Prize, and spends more time on the subjects that interest him even more, such as bongo drums.   More time is spent covering Feynman's escapades in Las Vegas than his lectures at Cornell.  <br />  Feynman was a junior engineer on the Manhattan Project, but anybody expecting any deep observations about Oppenheimer, or any essays about the morality of nuclear energy will be disapointed.   Instead, Feynman relates to us his stories of mischief in the New Mexico desert.    <br />  And who WANTS to read about Feynman's lectures in quantum mechanics?  Who WANTS to read about his Nobel Prize?  There are plenty of textbooks on those subjects.  Feynman would rather tell us about his loves, adventures, and observations outside of the classroom.  Feynman seems happier about being able to pick the locks of the world's most expensive safes, choreographing ballets using nothing but bongo drums, and outsmarting everybody that he comes in contact with.  If there were Nobel Prizes for curiosity, mischief, and all-out general smart-aleckness, Feynman would have to make multiple acceptance speeches.  <br />  Equal part Stephen Hawking and Hunter S. Thompson, Richard Feynman has led a life rivaled only by that of Forrest Gump.  But Feynman, instead, actually goes looking for adventure, and when he can't find it, he usually creates it.  <br />  A must read for those people who want to know if there is life beyond Physics.	1997-03-03

Strong female characters in fiction writing are becoming more plentiful, which I thing is outstanding.  Cases in point would be the protagonists of Patricia Cornwell and Phillip Shelby.  The V.I. Warshawski character is also very well rounded.  Not necessarily so with Sidney Archer of TOTAL CONTROL.  While she presented a strong sense of will in continuing to learn the fate of her husband, she was also a character who continuously made idiotic decisions that put her in danger.  Going back to her office to decrypt the disk was extremely poor judgement for a woman who is continuously hailed throughout the novel for her intelligence.  Also I felt that she was far too emotional for her own good.  There comes a time in the story when the woman must stop crying, and sobbing, and move forward to resolve her problem.  It seems that Sidney could not get through twenty pages without breaking down into tears, which I found very tiresome.  I feel David Baldacci is an excellent writer.  As a creative writng major at the University of Arizona, I believe I can learn from him, but I feel he could learn more about female portrayals in novels	1997-03-06

US	52826353	R6ESJ4JMEBBBR	0385472951	999720718	The Partner	Books	5	2	3	N	N	A new hope!	Finally...after having been drawn into following Grisham's<br />work with his first four books, I had become sorely disappointed with his last three efforts.  The Chamber and the Rainmaker, although good stories, were too much of a let down and the Runaway Jury, I am sad to say, has been one of the most difficult books to read and I have yet to finish it.  However, The Partner was a fast, non-stop read that kept me interested throughout the entire book.  The Partner is reminiscent of The Firm, but this time Grisham sets forth an intriguing story that starts at the end and eventually presents the reader with most of the details of the true story (or is it??).  The main character, Patrick Lanigan, can come across to some as a 'bad' guy and to others a 'hero' and that's the beauty of the story - the reader is able to make his/her own decision on why they want to root for Patrick or against Patrick.  At the end, after you have twisted and turned and think you completely understand the story, you realize that there are even more stories that could go on about this complex, intelligent (or not so intelligent) bad guy-hero.  I heartily recommend the lastest Grisham novel, not only for those who have never read Grisham, but also for those of you who may have lost interest and felt Grisham had perhaps fallen into the 'formula' writing that can become boring and predictable.  Renew your enthusiasm by reading The Partner!  I did.	1997-03-07

Opening the covers of this book is like  stepping into a time machine and visiting the squalor of 1920's Brooklyn, N.Y.    Here Betty Smith's descriptive magic plunges you into the ugliness of poverty   and the beauty of the people who fought to overcome it...  Francie Nolan, a dreamy child who finds her escape in books...  Johnny Nolan, her handsome young father, who finds his escape --   and ultimate tragedy -- in the bottle... and Katie Nolan, her beautiful,  hardened mother, who realizes that education is the only way her children   can escape the life she is forced to endure.    Although this novel was written many decades ago, modern readers will find   the prose to be shockingly frank and as realistic as it is descriptive.    The only fault with the book, which covers the span of Francie's life from   birth until college, is that it eventually has to end.    No history text can make the past come alive the way &quot;A Tree Grows in  Brooklyn&quot; can...no movie can leave its audience with more satisfaction  from a story well-told.  I dare anyone to read this book and not come   away a different person...it is, in fact, a true work of art.	1997-03-07

The idea is that when designing a new class hierarchy, though implementation details may differ, you often find yourself using the same kinds of solutions over and over again. Rather than approaching each design task out of context as an individual, isolated problem, the strategy is to study the task and identify the underlying design pattern most likely to be applicable, and follow the class structure outlined by that pattern. It's a &quot;cookbook&quot; school of design that works amazingly well.<br />There are other advantages to this book. It isolates 23 of the most common patterns and presents them in detail. You wouldn't think that 23 patterns would be enough, but once you become adept at recognizing patterns, you'll find that a large fraction of the patterns you use in practice are among these 23. For each pattern, the book carefully presents the intent of the pattern, a motivating example, consequences of using that pattern, implementation considerations and pitfalls, sample code (C++ or Smalltalk), known uses of that pattern in real-world applications, and a list of related patterns.<br />Upon first reading, you will start to recognize these patterns in the frameworks you see. Upon second reading, you'll begin to see how these patterns can help you in your own designs, and may also start to see new patterns not listed in the book. Once you become familiar with the pattern concept, you will be able to originate your own patterns, which will serve you well in the future. One of the most valuable contributions of this book is that it is designed not merely to help you identify patterns, but to give you a sense of which patterns are appropriate in which contexts.<br />I think this book is particularly valuable to many C++ and Java programmers, because of the dynamic and flexible design philosophy it follows. (Its two fundamental principles of reusable OO design are: &quot;Program to an interface, not an implementation&quot; and &quot;Favor object composition over class inheritance&quot;.) I've found that many C++ books unfortunately tend to emphasize a rather static and inflexible design philosophy. Many C++ programmers do not realize how the language and the books they've studied from have been limiting their thinking until they have been exposed to ideas from other lanugages.  The authors of this book have obviously been influenced by other languages as well, especially Smalltalk, and have brought many of its best lessons to C++ design. Most Java books seem to take after the C++ books, even though Java is a more dynamic language. This book may help Java programmers take full advantage of the extra power offered by their language, if they look deeply enough into some of the lesser-known features its runtime system affords.<br />Last, but not least, this book is valuable because it names the patterns it uses, and so gives programmers a common vocabulary to describe design concepts, rather than particular implementations. You'll find yourself saying things like, &quot;That would be a good use for a Decorator&quot;, or &quot;Should we use a Facade or a Mediator in this case?&quot; I encourage readers of this book to use this vocabulary with other programmers.<br />In summary, this is one of the few books that I think belongs on every programmer's &quot;must-have&quot; list.  Not to overuse a cliche, but like object-oriented design itself, the pattern concept is one of those rare paradigm-shifts in computer programming.  It is equally valuable to expert professional and novice student alike.  The book has a home page at [...]	1997-03-07

The book is a tour de force of weaving together a cast of cartoon characters, farcical plot  and a No Henry ending by means of talented prose. The guy can write but he demonstratively lacks anything to write about. Grisham's motto appears to be: Suspend any rational though when you read this book.<br /><br />His books fall into two classes: 1) Hate &quot;whitey&quot; polemics and 2) Action-Suspense without suspense but with random action.<br /> He would please me if he would join forces with another writer who had a head for story line, character development and had a logical mind.

Often, when a book is a part of a series, inexperienced readers expect &quot;more of the same&quot;.  Anne Rice has challenged her readers to view her Vampire Chronicles as a work along the lines of a biography for Lestat. The only consistency in life is its inconsistency - and this is aptly illustrated in Memnoch. In Memnoch, we are given the opportunity to see what has been rattling around in the immortal head of an entity that has witnessed centuries of life.  Though &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; gave us a look at his human life as a young man, Memnoch spins the tale of the kinds of concerns one has as maturity takes its toll on the way you were raised to view your relationship to the world. These are fundamental questions asked by humans in every language in existence.  Man is the only creature that engages in pursuits that have nothing to do with survival.  To ask &quot;why&quot; is practically what makes us humans. Civilization is built around the concept that man must make peace with his surroundings - surroundings he did not create.

Gaarder's book has found a place in my own group of books to always remember. A real jewel in a sea of overdone scripts. A web of ideas, historical facts, fantasy, moving insights into the life of a young woman, a cleverly architected (yet never to overwhelm the reader) sphere of self-reflecting reflections.

This is definitely the longest amount of time I've spent reading straight, yet propabley the shortest amount of time I've ever finished a book in.

I would recommend it to anyone. A must read. Concerning some of the other reviewers and their comments pertaining to Ender's Game's inadequacy when compared to &quot;great literature,&quot; I would have to say they are partly right. Card did not go out of his way to bury deep philisophical truths and social commentaries into the plot of Ender's Game. Ender's Game is not Steinbeck, but then Steinbeck is not as much fun to read :), and I think that is the point. I believe Card intended to write to as large an audience as possible by writing a terrific tale and appealing to the one thing common to every person: emotion, and he succeeds in every way. The 'truths' and 'ideas' of Ender's game are not masked and buried deep, which unfortunately seems to be the indicator of great 'literature' these days, they are brutally laid bare and made accessible to every reader. The great thing about Ender's Game is its power as a tale. It weaves so well, the reader has no choice but to be sucked in and experience the world and heart of Ender Wiggin. So for those who rated it a 1 because it isn't a &quot;literary masterpiece,&quot; you're right. But the comparison is irrelevant. If I judged Ender's Game as a fudge popsicle, I would be gravely disappointed and give it a '1' as well. Card wasn't attempting to write a work of great 'literature' when he wrote Ender's Game, he was trying to write a great story to be read by all. And a great story he wrote.	1997-03-18

It would be trite to call this the greatest English-language book ever written.  That would be too car salesmanish.  The back of the book tells you it's about the struggle between two brothers.  I feel that's oversimplifying it.  It's about the struggle about a group of people from prostitutes to farmers to soldiers to children to geniuses to simpletons to millionaires to hobos.  It blends Western and Eastern philosophies and makes you realize that at the core, most beliefs are the same because most people are the same.  And infinitely  different.  But this isn't only a philosophical romp for over 700 pages.  The prose is some of the most beautiful I've ever read.  A passage about a rabbit getting shot with an arrow moved me so much I read it about 10 times when I first encountered it.  The book took a long time to read not because it was difficult, but because I kept going back over and over.  The problem I've found with novels this long is the author's seeming inability to finish it gracefully if at all.  But here, the final scene couldn't be held together better and be more satisfying.    Yes, you do need to get through the first 50-100 pages, but after that, you'll realize it was a labor of love	1997-03-18

Blah, blah, blah. Sound familiar? I bet this is what you usually hear immediately after the word \\"philosophy\\" (not to mention \\"history,\\" \\"literature,\\" and a slew of other topics related to learning). Have you ever even had a remote urge to read a book on the history of western philosophy? More importantly, do you know any kids who have had such an urge? Picture sitting in the kitchen one day when your son or daughter comes in and says, \\"Gee, mom, I'd really like to read a book about philosophy. Just for fun.\\" Heck, most kids don't even know what philosophy means. Well, this may be about to change.  Sophie's World is fun and light hearted, sure to be enjoyed by everyone from pre-teens to adults. The genius of the book is the way a brief, yet comprehensive, summary of the history of western philosophy is smoothly integrated into the story. You hardly notice you are learning (in fact, it's probably best not to mention the \\"L\\" word to any kids you give the book to).    The book opens with young Sophie receiving a mysterious letter in the mail. Thus, with the help of a friendly stranger, she begins her quest towards self discovery while trying to unravel the mysteries of life.    As an added bonus, American readers will also learn a little about Norwegian culture (for example, in Norway you always answer the phone by saying your name, a habit that will seem strange and amusing to most Americans).    All in all, this book has everything to recommend it. After reading it, you are sure to pass it on to your friends like I did. Definitely a must read.	1997-03-19

In this aspect the book lived up to my expectation, yet I was disappointed in a way. There seems to be some humor missing in Eddings' approach to the whole story. The beginning was entertaining enough but then it started to get boring. This might be caused by the 'I' (that is Belgarath's) point of view of the whole story. I personally think the Belgariad series is the best work Edding has done, with the Mallorean series following close behind. I still take up a book from these two series and still feel the thrill of turning each page to reveal what happens in the next pages (despite the fact that I've probably read the whole thing a dozen of times). It's still worth the time reading it. This is not the same thing I can say about Eddings' prequel to the saga. I haven't picked up this book and read it again from cover to cover since the time I finished reading it for the first time. However, devout readers of Eddings should definitely not miss this book since it offers more insight to the Belgariad realm. It's nice to know more about Belgarath, but this book lacks the thrill and humor of Eddings previous books, which just proves the point that history is not meant to be entertaining	1997-03-22

By answering nearly all of the questions and tying up neatly all the loose ends from 2001 et. al., this book effectively destroys that wonderful sense of mystery and intrigue that was the heart of what made the other three Odysseys such wonderful books. It's a similar effect to if the X-Files suddenly revealed all of its secrets, except the Odysseys are longer running (and, in my opinion, even better). Also I was hoping to finally see HAL return (after his disconnection in 2001 and abandonment around Jupiter in 2010), but instead all we get is this awful quasi-Dave Bowman who's really rather uninteresting as Clarke's characters go. I did like the long vision of the future in this; I always like to see the perspectives on it of great authors like Clarke, but it takes up far too much of the book to be significant (only about half of 3001 is actually concerned with the plot; the other half is just Poole's experiences with the future). Finally I thought the plot in general of Poole returning was a bit weak; surely Arthur C. Clarke could have invented something more imaginative than that dime-novel trash. Overall I think 3001 was a pathetic ending to what has been one of the greatest series in science fiction history, and wish Clarke had simply left well enough alone with 2061 and not destroyed the whole core of the series with this trash	1997-03-23

Clarke's writing is the sheer poetry he managed to meld so successfully with the narrative. The city glowing like a jewel on the desert in &quot;The City and the Stars.&quot; The arrival of our primal fears in &quot;Childhood's End.&quot; The wonder of the artifact in &quot;Rendevouz with Rama.&quot;  Sadly, most of the poetry and the wonder was missing from his later, collaborative books. And although Clarke's physical difficulties have prevented him from writing more single-author novels in the past few years, I wish he had passed on authorship of 3001 to someone else. Then I would have been able to remember him from his past triumphs.    Although 3001 would have rated a 7 or 8 from a lessor author, from the past master it is a 3 at best. The narrative is rudely broken by what must be Clarke's thoughts of the world at present. Circumcision and religion may play a valid point in any novel, but the way they are addressed in 3001 reminds me more of Gernsback's polemeic Ralph 124C41+ than it does of the Clarke I look forward to reading. His opinions interrupt the narrative and do so in a way that doesn't advance the story line. Unforgivable in an author of his stature. Most of his 40-year-old short stories evoke more of a sense of wonder than this novel does. The mind &quot;sees&quot; the printed words in a book. 3001 requires significant allowance for myopia and astigmatism.    Wait for the paperback. Or better yet, wait for the Sci-Fi Channel adoption of the book. It couldn't be worse. Unfortunately, it might even be better.	1997-03-23

Whilst this book concentrates on the Vietnam experiences of a helicopter pilot, it also captures &quot;the way it was&quot; for all combatants. With clarity and immense detail, Mason reminds us of that incredible transition from civilian to soldier many of us went through and how miraculously the processing enabled us to cope with events and experiences of the war. The coping lasted until the end of your tour or until you were &quot;full up&quot; and getting a little frayed at the edges. A major element in holding men together in the insane stresses of combat is the fact that all those about you are doing the same thing - and nobody wants to be the first to crack. The resulting scenario is hundreds of men seemingly cruising unaffected through a roller-coaster ride in hell.  Using the same dry humour and understatement that was part of survival tactics at the time, Mason takes you on that ride, but kicks you in the stomach with an ending you struggle to comprehend. Meantime, Mason's plain English descriptions of learning to fly choppers are so breathtakingly realistic the average reader could jump in a Huey and take it for a joy ride on the first reading. This is one of those books where, on turning the last page you want to pick up the phone and chew the fat with the author	1997-03-24

In Michael Ondaatje's THE ENGLISH PATIENT, I've found a novel that achieves &quot;greatness.&quot; Such writing is why I first fell in love with literature...the novels of Hemingway, D.H. Lawrence, James Joyce, William Faulkner, Gertrude Stein, and Sherwood Anderson. This book has a masterful control of plot, characterization, themes, and style. And yet it reads like a dream...compelling and clarifying, ultimately revealing. I know Ondaatje as a poet of myth and mystery, of personal detail and intuition. I am struck at how much of that he brings to this novel. It is a inspiration, in part realized by the THE ENGLISH PATIENT film by Anthony Minghella under Saul Zaentz's production. The only thing the film has added are a few scenes to capture relationships; everything else you'll find in the book, including a deeper sense of theme and significance. It is, quite simply, the best book and film of our decade.  -Larry Smit	1997-03-27

The authors present curious information about the wealth of America's millionaires.  For example, information on the cost of clothing is derived from answers to questions like &quot;what was the most you've spent on a pair of shoes?&quot; from people who are admittedly their &quot;own favorite charity.&quot;  Similarly, the authors interpret wealth as something valuable, but, it seems, nothing useable.  Once a millionaire changes intangible worthy valuables to tangible, real, useable assets, the tax man will take a large portion of it away.  The book leaves me with the question: What good is it to amass large stores of wealth if only to be able to calculate and recalculate wealth - and never to use it to further life's enjoyment?  The authors don't even advocate liberating some of that wealth onto adult children or others who might apply some of its value in enjoyment.  I did enjoy the interpretation of offensive/defensive wealth and how most Americans are good at offensive wealth building -- we are a culture based on income levels.  However, we could stand some lessons rather than scolding on how to be better defensive wealth builders -- i.e. less consumption.  But I return to my primary question:  what is the value of wealth, in accumulating wealth, if it is just to to be accumulated and admired (valued) but never touched or enjoyed?	1997-04-02

The atmosphere stunningly chilly. The technical details are still immaculate, though surpassed by recent master technothriller Clancy.<br /><br />This novel may not send chills down the spine in the way it probably did 25 years ago. Time, however, have given this novel a sort of vintage quality, a certain &quot;class&quot; that Clancy and Ludlum can only dream of. It used to be that the only way one could read this novel was to stay up all night, even reading while in bathroom or kitchen. Now in 1997, you can sit back and take your time to enjoy it.<br /><br /> I would like to comment on the remark of an anonymous reviewer, who said &quot;The Jackal is much more entertaining in the hands of Ludlum&quot;. The Jackal in Ludlum's &quot;Bourne Identity&quot; is based (though exaggerated beyond credibility) on a real-life terrorist I.R. Sanchez a.k.a. The Jackal, who in turn was nicknamed so after the fictional assassin of this novel.	1997-04-02

Memnoch the Devil is not, I repeat NOT!!!, a Vampire Chronicle.  At least not in my opinion.  My question is why did Anne Rice, who is the master of weaving a character and breathing life into him, chose Lestat to be the protagonist  of such a religiously baised novel?  I loved every one of the Vampire Chronicles, couldn't wait to get my hands on the next one, but this one threw me for a really large loop. Earth circling you coulds say.  I don't know waht I expected but it certainly wasn't what Memnoch gave.  Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the book and have read and reread it on numerous occasions, recommend it to friends---but not as a continuation of the storyline established for Lestat in Interview with a Vampire. It is a different genre of book from the vampire tales and I, personally, object to it being included in the Vampire Chronicle series.	1997-04-02

In &quot;3001: The Final Odyssey,&quot; I felt that while a good read (have you ever anything that doesn't read well from Clarke?), it lacked the well defined imaginative classic qualities (like the &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;).  In fact, while reading the novel, I was disturbed by the narrow historical references (only back to the late 20th and early 21st centuries).

The Highly Sensitive Person by Elaine N. Aron is one of the most important books I have read.  Ms. Aron is both a HSP  (Higly Sensitive Person) and an accomplished Scientist.  It  is this unusual vantage point that gives the book its 3 dimensional depth.    It is estimated through a combination of genetic predisposition and less then perfect parenting in the first   few years of life that 28% of the American Population are HSP to a greater or lessor degree.    This sensitivity which probably becomes physiologicaly built in is a double edge sword.  On the plus side it allows this class of people to be particularly   aware of their envirionment.  This allows this group of people to get great pleasure from nature or the arts.  Being aware of their environment the are sensitive to other peoples feelings and tend to be associated with the gentler professions such as philosphy, judiciary, psychology.     However, in the buisness world that is measured in nanoseconds and the individual is lost in a soulless mass market the HSP is susceptiple to becoming overwhelmed.  Like a deer in a headlight.        The author then gives meaningfull suggestion on how the HSP can overcome and live with the limitations of their personality tendencies.  In this light, for an HSP this is truly a self-help book on a par with &quot;How to Win Friends and Influence People&quot;.         Professor Aron warns us that through out history HSP's  have been the socializing impulse behind the warrior king.  They have added the humanizing values that make life worth living.  It is ironic in this age when technology and science is giving us more and more power and control over nature,  there seems to be a corresponding lack of morality and search for meaning in society.  A culture that doesn't protect and nurture the possitive characteristic of Highly Sensitive People does so at its own peril.       I would like to talk to Professor Aron to discuss with her the possibility of starting an organization toserve this large number of people.	1997-04-05

It was almost as if they both shared the same thought process. I attribute this to the fact that the novels were written with such a short time span in between that Grisham did not have enough time to evolve a totally unique protagonist. I also felt that Grisham did not develop Eva's character in a way that would allow the reader to accept the ending of the story. Throughout the book she was made to seem totally devoted to Patrick and her father. For her to do what she apparently did in the end was totally out of character. On the other hand, I enjoy Grisham's style of starting his books with the climax and then filling in the details that surround it. This style of writing has the advantage of immediately drawing the reader into the story. The delight comes not in trying to second guess the protagonist, but in finding out all the deceptions and intricacies woven into his story. Altho	1997-04-07

Frank McCourt's story of growing up in beyond poverty  in Ireland catches the reader's attention and heart  almost immediately.  You will find yourself drawn to young   Frank and his miserable life.  There are times when you find   the book so sad you might want to stop reading, but please  don't.  This is a true story, and during that time life was   hard, very hard.  His descriptions from a child's  viewpoint never cease to amaze the reader -- how many of us   could write from the perception of a child, and do it so   well.  Be prepared to laugh out loud at certain points.       You would be smart to buy this book instead of taking it out  of the library.  It is a rare book that you will want to   underline your favorite passages to re-read to yourself   or someone else.  Mr. McCourt is an exceptionally talented   writer and I, for one, am anxiously awaiting the sequel to   this fine work!	1997-04-08

What is man really looking to find when he goes up against thebrute, unforgiving forces of nature? Into the Wild does a great jobexplaining why one must venture out into the great outdoors to come face to face with his true self. It's a great story, and because the author has first-hand experience similar to that of Chris McCandless, his writing has a special empathy that cannot be affected. As someone who has lived in New York City for several years, I found this read almost as refreshing and head-clearing as a real trip into the wild.	1997-04-08

Matilda was born with crummy parents who didn't  care about a single thing except money, and  a brother who did nothing but to eat, sleep  and watch the telly (television). Matilda  feels lonely, but with her love of books, and her unique intelligence, everything was already a bit alright.    She met a teacher, Ms. Honey, who had a kind  heart, but like her, was lonely. Ms. Honey  had a deep secret she wouldn't tell not to a  single soul, and Matilda is just destined to  help her.    But there was one problem- Ms. Trunchbull,  the biggest, meanest, creepiest, principal  you ever met in school. Just say one word  when she's talking and you'd be thrown down  in the chokey, or do something against her  rules, and be thrown out of the window. That's  what I meant. Someone had to stop her, though,  nobody dares to.    Matilda finds out she had supernatural powers,  and she knows she needs to use this, to make  everyone -who deserved it -to be a happy, including herself.    Read this book and find out what's next...this  book is one of Roald's best and I think children  of all ages could learn at least something from  this book.	1997-04-09

If you haven't seen the other Evil Dead movies (this is technically Evil Dead III) it's sort of hard to describe. The hero, Ash, is a square-jawed &quot;George of the Jungle&quot; type who seems to be forever plagued by demons. They tend to possess various parts of his body and make him do all sorts of machocistic things. (At the end of the last movie, he had to chop off his demonically possessed hand, then grafted the chainsaw he used onto the stump.) As this starts, he's been hurled back into medieval times and has to fight demons THERE, too. The key to these is that they're FUNNY, along with the horror. It's hard to describe, but if you have a strong stomache, it's hard to find better entertainment. There are in-jokes to everything from the 3 Stooges to &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;, mixed in with the blood and ichor. This one goes a bit more towards comedy than its predecessors, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's on cable a lot, check it ou END	1997-04-10

His entire life is spent in an attempt, which is eventually successful, to find inner peace.<br />  His plight is one that many people can relate to in that it begins with a classic struggle between a parent and a rebellious child who is ready to throw off the yoke of his father's and teachers' ideologies and move on to find his place in the world.<br />  Through many wrong turns and re-starts, all of which eventually lead him to his understanding of life, Siddhartha makes his way successfully.<br />  Some friends of mine consider the book on a lesser level than those books that are considered &quot;classics&quot; of literature.  This is due to the obvious story and lack of hidden meaning and sub-plot.  I, however, feel that what the book lacks in complexity it more than makes up for in applicability and comparability to most people's lives.  It is a book that makes you think.

Woolf gets inside their heads and writes down what they're thinking from moment to moment, creating an intimacy between reader and character I've experienced with no other writer.  The largest portion of the novel concerns a day at the Ramsay's summer house by the sea.  Mr. Ramsay, a once-famous philosopher whose reputation is beginning to wane, entertains two or three of his students, while Mrs. Ramsay, the novel's central character, manages her family and the other guests.  As Mr. Ramsay devotes his energy to philisophical obscurities, Mrs. Ramsay devotes hers to stroking her husband's ego when he needs it, consoling her youngest son James who wants to go to the lighthouse across the bay, and creating a serene, safe space for her guests.  Gradually, a portrait of English family life emerges, and more importantly, an understanding of a woman's place within it--Mrs. Ramsay has essentially sacrificed herself for her family and husband, and has done so willingly.  Woolf reveals these flawed but beautiful people to the reader in a work of art that seems less like reading prose than listening to music or experiencing a painting.  To the Lighthouse is one of the masterpieces of 20th-century English literature	1997-04-13

In Ignatious's case, it just means he's really cynical.   And hateful. If this book weren't so damn funny, it would be awfully hard to spend 300+ pages with Ignatious Reilly. One of the most spoiled, self-centered, lazy, and lunatic characters you'll ever meet, Ignatious has an audacity--like a Don Rickles insult--that makes you laugh in spite of whatever good manners you thought you had.    Surrounded by a cast of supporting characters, who are equally as repulsive in their own way, Ignatious takes you on a journey through the absurd.

Chinua Achebe, in &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot;, shows the exotic lives and ways of the Ibo people of pre-colonial Nigeria. The ways of the people are so appealing and so well-explained to Western readers, that we feel as though we are gathering yams from the farm, and offering agricultural sacrifice to our long-dead ancestors.    Achebe uses beautiful imagery to show how simplistic life before colonization was. The old-ways of the Ibo tribe are shown to be dogmatic to the main character, Okonkwo, who plays out to be more like a Greek tragic hero than an African farmer. Throughout the novel, are several Ibo words, adding to the strength of the imagery of the Ibo lifestyle.    &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; is a great read for anyone interested in African culture and/or the colonization effects of Western society.	1997-04-14

At the outset, I must say that I am a keen reader , first and last (a reviewer last). Arthur.C Clarke lives as they say in our general area of the pond (The Indian Ocean) and has no doubt been a witness to the fracticious and often unqualified opinions affected by one and all, on all and sundry. This should aclimitize him and by inference the many potential readers of the book  the quagmire that any well-known author or any well-read book lover faces. Its a simple problem that has been with us a long long time, it is called prejudice. A new tale is judged often by our expectations from/of the writers tale-telling ability/plotting style and very little from the story itself. Clarke is writer who probably in an attempt not to be bogged down in his own highly respected style of narrative, legitimizable SF, upset the apple-cart of many's expectations. 3001 may by many, not be considered the perfect sequel, if one goes by the negative critical acclaim that it has provoked.   <br /> But is not that the essence of a good book!  <br />  A book that makes one react is more relevant than one that does not, at least in terms of its impact on our collective conscience. Clarke (by the time tested wisdom called hind-sight) been an oracle of sorts in reporting mankinds technological and other tendencies, I for one trust him to be accurate (within some degree) in his anticipations. With due respect to a genuine visonary, I have never been a great admirer of his linguistic style, often sparse and somtimes forced. BUT and this is the most important 'BUT' what he conceives and projects in his tales are signposts, guiding beacons in the uncertain future and that too in very humanistic terms.   <br />  I would reccommend  Mr.A.Clarke to any one, any time, any where, any work, just for the insight. 2001 was and is an icon, Kubrick insured that, can we not make room in our minds for more?	1997-04-15

Well, unlike some of the others here, I don't consider it to be one of the greatest sci-fi books ever written or anything like that. (Childhood's End might qualify...) However, it IS a solid sci-fi book, not to mention novellization of the movie. Standing on its own, it's a bit dry, but raises some interesting questions. Mostly having to do with the Monolith and those that created it. However, it is best read as a sort of guide to the movie. It certainly won't answer all the questions, NOTHING will ever do that, but it will give you a lot better idea what's going on in some cases. However, don't take what he says to be fact. After all, when he wrote it, they were still going to send the Discovery to Saturn. (until they realized what a pain making its rings would be) And the ending, I think, is way too literal, although I have no idea how you could have a writen equivilent of the movie's purely visual end.

I probably still don't, but at least I can now appreciate the value that  \\"art\\" held for the patrons of the arts (specifically oils) during the 16th, 17th, 18th and 19th centuries.   One learns to appreciate the value these paintings held not only for the patrons who commissioned the paintings but for their peers and the other social classes of the time.  Mr. Berger's theory to a degree is that these oils functioned as a sort of touchtone of wealth and status and, in a socially fashionable, acceptable and clever way,  showcased one's earthly possessions and station in life.  The patron via the painting told the world: I am socially, spritually and, on occasion, sexually superior. This commissioned \\"art\\" was a tasteful one-upmanship show.  The patron called the shots where the iconography in the painting was concerned and the artist, inevitably a man of talent but with expenses, complied. This is not to say that the masters were hacks.But to coin a phrase they knew on which side their canvas was oiled.  Nothing much seems to have changed today, accordiing to Mr. Berger. And here his theory of the function of visual art comes into clear focus. Mr. Berger uses this brief but dense text to do nothing less than show up or expose the power and fraud  of marketing in contemportary society. Society appears to be a universe of unhappy individuals sharing the collective belief that by possessing or rather acquiring certain social icons they will be empowered and/or achieve everlasting hapiness. This is just an illusion of the genius of marketing--which is what the oils did during the age of the Masters!  Interestingly enough, the tone of the book is not ironic but straightforward. The prose is not pedantic or abstract. It does not assume any knowledge of the history of art or of history for the matter. The text contains 155 black and white pictures of different works of art to illustrate his points. I wish they hadbeen in color but I assume it would make the cost of the book prohibitive. These minor points lead me to believe that  this book based on the BBC series was aimed for the mass market as opposed to the academic world.    The conclusions Berger reaches in this age of multi-national markets, globalization and concentration of media  are downright radical. Read this book before it is censored forever.	1997-04-17

IT has one of the most interesting and structural foundations from what I have read in many years. Unless King comes out with something beyond genius in the incoming years, IT, especially after King's own death, I'm sure will be looked upon as his best work of horror fiction.

Although the author is no literary genius, and the writing was not brilliant, the power of the message cannot be denied.  The similarities between Australia's treatment of the Aborigines (i.e., the propaganda disseminated about their supposed inferiorities, etc.) and America's treatment of our Native Americans and our Black population were chilling.  Of course it would be disgraceful and disgusting if the accusations are true that Morgan exploited the Aborigine people to write a bestseller to enrich her finances.    But all of those issues are extraneous to the message of the book which I found to be profound and deeply touching, especially as I read this at a time when unhappy life situations were threatening to engulf me in depression.  The &quot;Real People's&quot; message brought me back into the sunshine, putting the details of my life into perspective.  As I attempt to encourage friends and family to read this book, I have found it nearly impossible to express exactly how the message affected and enlightened me.  It is my opinion that it is irrelevent whether this is a true story of a small tribe of people, living life at its most basic, or if it is a figment of the author's imagination.  The whole point was the message which most of the reviewers missed in their haste to jump on the author and her motives for writing it.  Who cares?

It shows the development of his scale pattern approach to improvisation, and remains quite melodic.    The CD has bonus tracks that number almost as many as the original album, adding tracks from the &quot;Alternate Takes&quot; album.  After listening to Giant Steps for years, it is great to hear the extra solos on these great tunes.  In addition to Coltrane's great sound is a superb rhythm section, including bassist Paul Chambers.  I rarely pass up a chance to check out a Paul Chambers recording. END	1997-04-22

Sagan is a great scientist but he's a pedestrian novelist. I'd call him a poor man's Michener. The characters in Contact are stereotyped and dull. Some sections lag such as the exposition of Ellie's childhood which, apart from being banal, was unreasonably long notwithstanding that it ties in with the ending. I also found the &quot;real science&quot; aspect -which other readers have said is the books strength -to be a little elementary and a little skimpy. Seems to me that Sagan spent a lot more time in musing on religion vs science than on the technology or the science of SETI (and he does this via too many  unauthentic long speeches).

I cannot give this book a lesser rating, because it was not a complete disaster.  It was definately very thought compelling, but it lacked the heart and soul of the previous Vampire books.  I read it straight through like the others, more out of loyalty and hope that it would get better.  I did enjoy the story, don't mistake me.  However, the characters were not as alive as in the previous books and the plot was all over the place. The wordiness reminded me of the Mayfair Chronicles; I was enthralled with the possibilties of the story, but at times did not think I could read another word.  In conclusion, this was not what I had anticipated it to be, and so am still feeling unfulfilled about the destinies of my vampire LeStat and my Louis, as well as the others.

Swept away by her delightful first novel, Voyageur, I lost several weeks of my life devouring the second and third in Gabaldon's series. I lost  further time to Drums of Autumn, the latest (but   alas not greatest) installment.    Gabaldon is a highly gifted writer, able to  present a marvellously deep and textured world. Unfortunately, this book lacks the  depth and rich layering of the previous novels.    For this, I must indict Gabaldon's editors. What  is here is vintage &quot;Jamie and Claire&quot;, but the  narrative seems rushed, breathless; hardly more   than an outline.    The introduction of Brianna and Roger is perfect,  but their story is given short shrift, and one   longs for more detail, more exploration.

Viktor Frankl originally intended to publish  &quot;Man's Search for Meaning&quot; anonymously.

This is a large book of splendid, eerie illustrations of an impossible world in a parallel universe, with copious comments in an incomprehensible language in an imaginary script. A world at once familiar, inhabited as it is by humans, and hauntingly different, with its very own laws of physics, its strange fauna, its stranger flora, its unimaginable society, technology, even mathematics. The Codex Seraphinianus is to that world what Diderot's Encyclopaedia is to ours, only lavishly and artistically illustrated. A feast for the eyes, a tease for the brain, to which you will find yourselves drawn again and again, and again, in ever renewed fascination.

The battle occurs in the very distant future against the backdrop of complicated Universal politics and intrigue.

And I was so looking forward to a good read... <br />  I forced myself to read the first 255 pages (and every blessed footnote along the way) of this Generation-X encyclopedia of drugs, alcohol, and adolescent tennis before I decided to stop torturing myself and throw the book away. Oh, the guilt! Since books are my passion, throwing one in the trash was, well, difficult.  <br />  So what's wrong with it? Have you ever seen one of those pictures that at first glance looks like nothing more than millions of colored dots? If you relax your eyes and look &quot;through&quot; the dots, a 3-D picture begins to take shape, and pretty soon you don't see the dots at all because you're inside the picture. That's as close as I can get to the magic of reading a good book. Sadly, with Infinite Jest, I couldn't find the story inside the words. I was always uncomfortably aware of the &quot;dots&quot; - of Wallace's sentence structure, his choice of words, his background research, and, most of all, the prodigious amount of EFFORT that went into this book.  <br />  Infinite Jest contains a thousand pages of disjointed character sketches with nothing but the book binding to hold them together.

I read this book without being biased by hearing about or seeing its epynymous movie, and I  thought it was one of the three best books  I've ever read (the other two are The Grapes  of Wrath and Huckleberry Finn).  It may seem  strange to write a book about World War II   now after so many others have been written, but  after all, that event shaped our current society like no other.  And, as I see it, the  second world war resulted in the usurpation of  Great Britain as the dominant world power.  Even  so, everyone still recognizes the British accent  as commanding, although the face may be   disfigured.  That theme, coupled with the nurse's  connection by gender to the nuns - who left the  monastery providentially stocked - is deftly   played upon by the nurse's alternating sensual  attractions to the helpless/dominant English  patient and to the assertive/effeminate bomb  defuser.  I recommend this book to anybody  with a sense of recent history, good literature,  and the intricacies of attraction and love.	1997-05-04

Nowhere are these more evident than in the passages describing little Frankie McCourt having to hunt through all the pubs on his street to find his father, who is somewhere drinking away 5 pounds sent to the family in honor of a new baby.  The reader is impressed by the lack of bitterness in the grown Frank McCourt; he simply tells what happened with warmth and humor and compassion.<br /><br /> Whether the reader is laughing at the author's frank, hilarious descriptions of his own sexual awakening, or shaking his or her head over the passages describing the deaths of his two brothers and only sister, they will, as they close the book, wonder immediately when the sequel will be available.	1997-05-04

Not a very successful one.... He has a small, battered ship with a long, ridiculous name... There is no crew to worry about, only the man himself. And he -- well,  he's a little ridiculous, too. He'll give us no trouble... He keeps  cats, I hear... If he so much as threatens to report us, the hireling  and I can dispose of him and feed him to his cats&quot;.    Thus does Kaj Nevis, adventurer ordinary in a distant future, describe  Haviland Tuf to his motley gang, whereby you have guessed that they are  up to no good. But Haviland Tuf, skipper, owner, crew and sole  shareholder of the &quot;Cornucopia of Excellent Goods at Low Prices&quot;,  nevertheless ends up the master of the prize coveted by Kaj Nevis: the  last ship of the long-forgotten Genetic Corps for late Galactic Empire,  a 30-mile long leviathan, with working weaponry and tens of thousands of  operational cloning vats ready to spew biological death in any form from  deadly alien bacteria to a herd of Terran Tyrannosaurus Rex. How Tuf,  the gentle giant with a fondness for cats, onion pies and ale, and with  a paunch to match, now self-taught genetic engineer, has the gigantic  ship repaired and roams the galaxy to set aright half a dozen mand-made  impending ecological disasters, that is the rest of the tale. Barely  ever lifting a finger, and never his voice, soft-spoken long-suffering  Tuf, with a kitten or two peering out of his ample  pockets, teaches a stinging lesson to the bloodthirsty arena masters of  Norn, unmasks the false messiah of Charity, and brings peace between the  sea-dwelling aborigines of Namor and the human settlers who had mistaken  them for tasty tidbits. But it takes him two attempts to solve the  runaway population explosion of S'uthlam which threatens the peace with  its neighbours (Lebensraum! Lebensraum!).    The characters come to life, splendidly. No two are alike, each is  strongly typed, even the most minor. No two have the same mannerisms,  the same speech, the same personality. Yet they are never caricatures.  They are all dreadfully ordinary in their unusual ways, from Kaj Nevis  the psychopathic wannabe master-of-the-universe to Celine Waan, the  lawsuit-happy loud-mouthed gross blockhead academic, we've all met their  kinds. The worlds visited by Tuf are equally imaginative, credible, and  diverse. It all adds up to just under 400 pages of sheer delight. The  hardback is out of print, but Victor Gollancz of London did bring out a  paperback in 1988 (ISBN 0-575-04266-4).  Failing that, hunt around for  old issues of Analog: January, February, October, November, mid-December  1985, October 1981, and February 1978, where most of Tuf's voyages were  published.	1997-05-05

Stephen King is known as the master of horror, but one must never be blinded by the media's cries of &quot;scarry!&quot;.   I prefer to think of King as a master storyteller, and leave it at that.  Here King has woven one of his most intricate tales, a tale of good versus evil as much as a tale of the transition from child to adult.  For those unfamiliar with the plot, It deals with a group of seven children, misunderstood and shunned by all other peers, who find each other, and are joined by a common factor: every one of them has had a run in with It, which is the name they have given to the embodiment of evil that resides in the sewers and the dark places of their home town of Derry, Maine.  The book deals not only with their battles with It, but also with their battles with their peers, their families, and themselves.  The book follows the group through a two month interval in 1958, and follows them through to their reunion, circa 1985, when a forgotten promise draws them together again for a final battle with It.  I had read this book at least ten times by the time I was eleven years of age,  and have read it many times since. I had the fortune to be able to expierence this book from a child's view, and then from an adults, much like the characters in the book.  I feel that anyone who is not intimidated by the huge size of this book would enjoy it immensely.  And to those who are intimidated- give this book a try anyway.  I feel that it could be one of the finest things you have ever read	1997-05-05

How else do you explain their desire to place themselves into the lives of, or to become, fictional strangers, even when the outcome results in having your heart ripped out?  The answer has something to do with &quot;want&quot;; readers want what characters want.  Or readers want characters.  Especially in this case, in which the object of desire is a tease yet a prude; glossy yet tainted; experienced yet naive. Holly Golightly is as complex a character as ever written, but a hell of a lot more desirable, and I want Holly Golightly.<br />  Capote has penned the quintessential &quot;bitch,&quot; which can only be defined as someone with the unique ability to pull someone in emotionally while pushing them away physically.  And while Holly is a &quot;bitch&quot; of a character, Capote is a &quot;bitch&quot; of a writer, and &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany's&quot; is a &quot;bitch&quot; of a book.  At the novel's onset, I met Holly, instantly fell in love with her, and from there I spent my time chasing her, and I chased her until the conclusion, the point when I realized that my pursuit was futile.  (This quest lasted for approximately two hours.)  So what did I do then? I picked up the book and started reading it again.<br />  &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany's&quot; is for gluttons for literary punishment--and I mean this in the most satisfying way--which should be anyone who enjoys reading.  This is an almost perfect book that satisfies while leaving the reader longing for more.	1997-05-05

On the bestseller list for a gazillion weeks, template for a thousand imitators (and not a few sequels), guiding light for millions of spiritual seekers, &quot;The Road Less Traveled&quot; may be one of the most quietly influential books of the last quarter-century.  Which is a great pity, because it's a bad book.<br /><br />The flaw lies not in its overtly Christian message, nor in its rather Puritan insistence on discipline and labor.  Such beliefs are not to be mocked.  No - I object to this book because I think it is simply meanspirited, a sadly cocksure display of guru-ship that is not different in kind from EST or Scientology.  It gains an audience by convincing the reader of some terrible, insurmountable character flaw, but holds out only a few vague platitudes as solutions.  It's classic bait-and-switch, successful only because it causes the very self-doubt its rhetoric seeks to relieve.  Friends who've read the book say what a great comfort it is - but are unhappier after reading it.  Thus, hoplessly, they read it again, and again, and commend it to their friends...and no one gains by it.  Rather like some addicting drug, or a beautiful promise that always remains unfulfilled.	1997-05-05

Our rivalry finally ended when I left home at 18.  We are now good friends, but I wish that my parents had read this book during our childhood.   Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish, authors of &quot;How to Talk so Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk&quot;, share years of experience gained through their own parenting trials and through those of the thousands of parents who have attended their workshops.  Their aim is to teach parents the skills and techniques necessary to redirect rivalry into cooperation.  Topics such as teaching parents to stop treating their children equally instead of uniquely, helping children express their angry feelings acceptably, motivating children to solve their own problems, and handling fighting are expertly covered.  This best-selling book puts the reader right into the middle of a fictional workshop, sitting with other frustrated parents, asking questions and working out solutions.  Each chapter begins with questions aimed at helping parents to understand and acknowledge the feelings behind a common problem.  The book then describes the communication skills necessary to defuse the rivalry and gain cooperation instead of arguments.  Theory is  put into practice in cartoon form.  A problem is presented in a cartoon, which shows the &quot;typical&quot; way an untrained parent would respond, and then the way the problem could be resolved using the new techniques the authors teach.  The last chapter of the book explores ways in which we can mend fences and renew our relationships with our own adult siblings.  Several poignant stories illustrate that it is never too late to learn effective communication skills. I found this book useful for parents of only children, since the skills presented are as useful for dealing with one child as for many.  For  parents of two ormore children, this is a MUST READ	1997-05-05

Nothing is any longer one thing! I take up a handbag and I think of  an old bumboat woman frozen in the ice&quot; (305). <BR> <br />Orlando examines how experience creates meaning. It is a discussion of intertextuality where metaphors are created diachronically. Meaning is created, however imperfectly, by the piling up of associations with a particular image. The book illustrates both the creation of imperfect meaning, but also the undeniably human desire to communicate those ideas.  <br />By repeating images, Orlando supposes, we give them meaning. The oak tree, for example, evolves meaning through time. At the beginning it's just an image: a boy alone on a hilltop contemplating the way that the roots feel. Then Orlando removes it from reality by making it into a poem. He adds things in the margin, reworking, elevating the image until it is not a boy under a tree at all. He takes the real and  compounds it until it becomes abstract. When Orlando finally lays down under the tree at the end, having &quot;given birth&quot; to the manuscript, the action  has a completely new meaning. It is attached forever to Turkey and gypsies and the whole life that preceded it. It transcends image and object to become allegorical. When Woolf describes it she is not merely describing an image, she is attempting to communicate a life.   <br />By layering the image in the text, adding meaning on top of meaning, the number of interpretations grows exponentially. The novel would submit that this is the way of language and life. Like metaphors, people are not just as they are at the moment but are also everything and everyone that has preceded. They are the past: the trees that they have sat under and the words that they have spoken. The whole of a person can never be communicated, only approximated in images and metaphors. And yet it's &quot;a curious fact that though human's... have such imperfect means of communication, that they can only say `good to eat' when they mean `beautiful'... they endure ridicule and misunderstanding [rather] than keep any experience to themselves&quot; (144).  ORLANDO is, definitively, Good to Eat	1997-05-06

All of the above?<br /> John Grisham has a carefully crafted intricate plot in The Partner, one of his most controversial novels yet.  There is less legal technical detail here than we find in many of his books; this makes for a fast read and entertaining chase scenes.  Grisham wraps up The Partner with a somewhat unsatisfying denoument, as unsatisfying as, say,the ending of Rainmaker.<br /> On the Grisham scale, Partner ranks far above The Chamber, but perhaps a bit below Runaway Jury and The client.	1997-05-10

On the one hand, this book is, as much as I hate to say it, brilliant.  It's funny, it's a deft satire, and it gave me a lot to chew on.  I stuck with it for a thousand pages, though, because I was interested in and cared about the characters.  And here's the problem.  The post-modern cuteness of it all is sort of admirable on an intellectual level, but the non-ending is profoundly unsatisfying because the book also works on an emotional level. I cared about the characters, and I wanted to know what happened to them. While I admire what Wallace is doing, and while I get the fact that he is wink-winking at us about it,( James Incandeza's films are &quot;anti-confluential&quot;, so I guess I should have known the book wasn't going to &quot;flow together&quot;) I still felt cheated.     Does this make me some sort of philistine?  Maybe, but I think that there is skill involved in pulling all the threads of a novel together, and I think Wallace is able to do it but decides not to in order to advance his themes. I feel like there is an implicit contract involved in a book like this--stay with me for a thousand pages, and I'll make it worth your while.  While Infinite Jest is certainly an entertaining ride, its &quot;anti-confluential&quot; ending violates that contract.  I'm annoyed.	1997-05-11

His research is excellent. It is obvious that his demeanor is such that people speak to him openly. His book is a wonderful exposition of the life and final times of this complex young man. However, Krakauer lacks the knowledge and experience to fully assess the motivations and actions of Chris McCandless. He projects too much of his own youthful lust for adventure into the character of Chris and fails to see the essential element of McCandless which is a young man who simply doesn't fit inside of his skin and is seeking a way out of it.  McCandless anger against his parents is a projection of his discontent with himself. He invents a new persona in each new location and maintains friendships for periods just brief enough to keep the illusion from paling.  In spite of his failure to correctly analyze Chris's motivations Krakauer writes an excellent description of McCandless. He doesn't include solely the things that reinforce his personal analysis. It is a fine book, probably worth reading several times to truly see and understand the disaffection so prevalent in Chris McCandless' generation	1997-05-14

It takes watching 10 to find 1 that's any good.  This is one of the &quot;1's&quot;. The number of reviews on this book is a fitting testament to this work.  While I have just finished reading it for the first time, there's no doubt I'll be reading it again.  My only regret is that I didn't read the book many years earlier.

Sapir's 1921 &quot;Language&quot; is one of the finest of many fine works by the distinguished linguist, anthropologist and humanist. With piercing yet accessible insight, he guides the reader through  fundamental questions about language: How are culture and language related? How does language work? How do languages vary?   Although there are many general introductions to the subject (Bloomfield's and Jesperson's volume come to mind), Sapir's is unmatched for sheer readability in interest. Highly recommended.	1997-05-15

I'm from the midwest, no one and nothing is a ten.  Let's say it's a 9+.<br />  It's been five or more years since I read this great book.  After reading it, I immediately went out in search of (and read) its sequels &quot;Speaker For the Dead&quot; and &quot;Xenocide&quot;.  That in itself is a tribute to my appreciation of this book.<br />  Andrew Wiggin (aka Ender) is (like me) a player of games.  He plays games so well, that he becomes the Earth's greatest military genius.  But is this a good thing?<br />   Ender's brother and sister are similar to him, but not militarily oriented.  They become Earth's greatest POLITICAL genius.  (The singular noun here is intentional.  Read the book.)<br />   The book focuses on Ender and his exploits in learning to save the human race from extinction at the hands of the alien race known as the buggers, but a critical subplot is what his brother and sister accomplish here on Earth using what the Internet has matured into.  Mind you, this book was written before the Internet became a household word.<br />   Ender has been engineered (more or less) to destroy the buggers, but he is still a human, and he must learn to live with what he is.  He sees his brother as evil, but the evil in his brother is the good in him.<br />   This book is filled with similar contradictions.  In essence, the author paints a picture of humanity and forces the reader to decide whether this is good, or bad.  Then, as if that's not enough, he gives the reader a mirror image of that picture, and requires another decision; good or bad?<br />   You decide.<br />   But before you make your final decision, you might want to read the sequels...Speaker for the Dead, and Xenocide.<br />   Enjoy.	1997-05-16

I finished it in less than three hours, and felt that I had witnessed part of myself on Camus' stage.  M. Meursault is, for the most part, an ordinary person who has been benumbed by a daily existence of &quot;getting by.&quot;  Finding himself so dulled, that finally, he is a mere spectator in his own life.  &quot;Effect&quot; instead of &quot;Cause.&quot;  The story begins with a death, and ends with a death.  In the folds of each is found new life, whether it is his Maman's &quot;fiancee&quot; or Meursault's own rebirth of consciousness in his final minutes.  Perhaps through this story, we can all find something of ourselves in M. Meursault, and heed the warning that seems to glare in mile-high neon.  Be &quot;Cause.&quot;  Not &quot;Effect.&quot;  Get out and LIVE.  Live heroically instead of being a spectator or simply &quot;getting by.&quot	1997-05-16

I have never been very interested in pirates or plunder or the skull and crossbones flag until I read this book.  Captain Long John Silver has been   quite a fictional figure not only for my self but for the world (ex. Long John Silver's restaraunts).  I must admit that I liked the book, but there was a flaw in it that I found.  Jim Hawkins made the plotline a little too obvious at times.  In one spot expecially, might I point out, he says that the apple barrel would in time save them all.  Now that's a little obvious, don't you think?  Perhaps if the author had found a way to avoid these give-aways I would have been more surprised with the story line than was when I read it for the first time.  In the end, it's an exceptional piece of work, but the author did make some unforgivable mistakes at making the plot too obvious too soon.  Oh well.  I do have one more thing to say, though.

Palahniuk's novel was a bit lost in the scramble of promoting and reviewing current &quot;literary&quot; fiction.  Norton issued it as a mainstream novel, but may have made a mistake by not promoting the book's affinity with postmodern apocalyptic fiction by J. G. Ballard, who obviously influenced this author's work.  He isn't an easy read; Palahniuk pushes his obsessions about as far as Poe did in his most outre work (e.g., &quot;Berenice&quot;), but is never less than riveting.  I read much of the book in public in airports on a flight home at Christmas, and if I had started reading aloud I might have been arrested on the spot.  Palahniuk gets down to the grungiest, most painfully disturbing level of life in his portrait of contemporary underground men (literally so, since the &quot;fight clubs&quot; are staged in basements).  There's a trick ending in this book--but without it the book might have gone downhill, since the earlier parts are so over the top.

I spent several fine dollars on this book, purchasing it because of reviews on Amazon.com and because of the beautiful, waxy cover. When I began reading, the story started out quite nice, with a boy as a shepherd.  I would have liked to know more about his years on end of solitude and walking. Anyhow, do get to the point, the author got to the point too blatantly.  Hardly any subtlety was used by the author -- the moral was sitting in plain sight the entire time.  At time, the reading actually got tedious -- though if I say that I like to read story, I seem childish, I believe that the most effective way to get a point across is through complex and underlying weaves in and out of the plot, scene, symbols, and dialog.  So, if you see the book laying around and have a few hours to spare, read it.  Why not.  It was nice enough.  However, if you have anything else around that you think might be worth reading, it probably should be read before this one.  It just didn't cut it in the realm of inspirational literature, and I've read lots.	1997-05-19

This time, the story evolves in a university setting and our determined hero Richard Silver is an Assistant Professor in business who exudes natural teaching ability, but is a bit short on securing academic tenure. Critical Chain is as much an indictment of our current crop of non-relevant MBA programs as it is an expose of how TOC (Theory of Constraints) concepts can rejuvenate project management. Goldratt is well aware of the lack of relevance of some of today's university MBA offerings, as well as the growing list of companies creating their own programs, including such efforts as General Electric's highly regarded Crotonville leadership academy.  Never at a loss for a solution to problems which are first clearly identified using TOC methodology and associated Thinking Processes, Goldratt proceeds to solve project management uncertainties which, in the past, have defied even intensely focused, albeit more conventional solution attempts.  Transforming critical path technology into critical chain thinking, lies at the heart of Goldratt's TOC-driven project management philosophy. Using critical chain methods, the author shows us how to plan, implement, and execute projects according to &quot;real-world&quot; mandates, AND get them done in time and within budget.  TOC basics have taught us that every system has constraints and that invariably constraint time is more valuable than non-constraint time. This understanding is also basic to effective project management, as amply demonstrated by our story's other heroes, Professor Silver's students in his Project Management class.    Critical Chain's message is so logical and simple that it will probably take years before its &quot;revolutionary&quot; new technology will be accepted by today's critical path pragmatists. Don't waste your time with such uninformed skeptics. Hopefully, most of them will be working for the competition.  Read this book and find out how to use common sense, the TOC way, and complete your projects on time, every time.  Most of us have been involved with projects which didn't stand a chance of ever achieving their stated objectives. According to Eli, such predicaments are history, if you tackle them his Critical Chain way.  Bruno Lewandowski, Editor, World Aero-Engine Review.	1997-06-02

I'm sure 99% of the reviews here will rave about the humor of the book, so further testimonial regarding the comedic greatness of this book probably isn't necessary.       What else is truly special about this book, however, is its mastery of American written english, and its portrayal of New Orleans spoken accents of the early sixties.  As you read the book, you can hear the people speak and see the city in perfect, rich, and colorful detail.  Perhaps the best part is Toole's absolute ability to describe situations, objects, and people with perhaps the richest, most creative use of simile I have have ever seen from an American writer.  It's a shame that much of the language and subsequent humor will be lost to those who aren't American (although I believe quirky Brits will cry with laughter when they read this).         I am on to my second reading of the book, and the second time through is even better than the first. And each chapter, paragraph, sentence, and word is so complete, I can set the book down for a month and come back to it, and it seems as if I had just finished reading the previous chapter yesterday.           And of course I'm laughing all the while.  And the best part of it all?  The ending will not dissapoint the reader.  I half expected this book to end weakly, but it doesn't.         I will never forget this book, and most people I know feel the same way.  Too bad Toole killed himself.  Genious gone before it was even discovered, truly tragic.  But in reading the book, this fact only leads the reader to appreciate and be thankful that something of Toole was left for us to enjoy and admire.  I can only imagine that he must have been an incredibly amazing individual, and funny as hell!  Read it, this is a must for anyone, casual or avid reader.	1997-06-02

A libertarian's manifesto, Rand mercilessly tore into collectivism, which was something of a political reality - even in America - when the book was written.  While her characters are philosophically monolithic and extreme in their behavior, so much the better for their full development and the reader's immersion in the life-long struggle of architect/genius Howard Roark against incompetence and the status quo.  A work of philosophy that passes itself off as a page turner, Rand presents a compelling argument in favor of a capitalistic meritocracy ideal.  Brilliant writing and powerful thinking are merged in what will surely be regarded as a literary and philosophical classic centuries from now	1997-06-03

After having read all of Grisham's books (some more thantwice), I can say that &quot;The Partner&quot; is okay.  There is noother word that describes it more accurately in my opinion.  It is a good read on a very boring Sunday afternoon, if you don't play gholf. It is more in the league of &quot;The Rainmaker&quot;, which means I will not read it a second time.  It concerns a young innocent partner (yeah sure) who was very devious (in a good way) in dealing with his, oh so corrupt firm of older mean lawyers - sound familiar? Right on!  As with all of Grisham\222s other novels, it is an easy and somewhat absorbing read, but please don\222t expect &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; - It will not keep you awake until 2am the next morning, but might give you pleasant dreams.	1997-06-04

Clark, no doubt thisbook suffered a lack of continuity so great that even the apollogiesfrom Clark's own are not enough to justify this book...<br /> I am specially sad about the involution wich Clark aprouched the aliens, the creators of the Monoliths, and the completelly unsatisfying end to Hall and Dave Bowman. I read the first book delighted until the end, and one of the most delightfull parts is for sure when Dave Bowman pass through the Gate ( wich is Big Brother, something clear in the first book and its sequel...), seeing the mammoth space ports and gateways, some of them even being at use while he was passing by... That alone tells that the Monoliths creators mastered FTL travell, and this is completelly denied in this last book !!!How can he write that a message from the Monolith delays 450 years to reach it's Central, if Dave Bowman made the first trip almost instantly, and returned a few years later ??!! And we all know that his transformation to his new form happened in the Gates Central, in the surface of a Sun ( another beautifull part of the original book )and not inside the Big One orbiting Jupiter, something so repeated on this 3001... Of course this was one of the basis for the story, but so this must not be a sequel to 2001. Let alone the fact that the end of the star child is completelly out of the lines guided on the first books. Of course Dave Bowman became more than a computer image, from a stupid yet powerfull machine.<br /> Fact is, this so called sequell just levelled the Monoliths and its creators to a levell far under the preview books, and I prefer to stuck on the first ones, hopping that someday Clark or his collaborator, Gentry Lee (a great writer himself) maybe take notice of the terrible mistakes done in this story and fix it, giving a really sactisfatory end to this magnificent tale, something that we fans of this series are actually lacking right now. For me this book never happened, and letour voices get to mr. Clark, in order to make him notice our sadness about this matter... <br /> Claudio Marcos Maciel Leme,<BR> from S\343o Paulo - Brasil	1997-06-04

A delectable piece of near-non-fiction about one of the most evocative and emotive artists of the nineteenth century, Auguste Rodin. I came upon this book (original hardback with cover c. 1963) via the shelves of a former paramour  just after graduating from art school, a happy coincidence for a dewey-eyed artiste! Not a lover of the biography genre in particular, I devoured this  book nonetheless, in part because it is loosely-based fiction, but primarily because David Weiss has molded a remarkable figure in his story of Auguste Rodin.<br /><br />From his birth in Normandy in 1840 and first crayons at age five, through his tumultuous entree into the world as an artist (he was born to a minor police official), to the development of his work alongside some remarkable contemporaries (Monet, Renoir, Hugo, Zola, Rilke and Shaw) and the tragic affairs with Beuret and Claudel, it's a book you'll find hard pressed to close long after bedtime has come and gone (note: bring home the film _Camille Claudel_ when you have finished the book to add a little color to your perspective).<br /><br /> A minor flaw, which I quickly forgave as the characters emerged, might be the slightly formal tone (hasn't he heard of contractions?) in which Weiss, scholar before bestselling author, constructs his prose. Otherwise as powerful, colorful, and unforgettable a glimpse at the artist as Rodin's own Balzac.	1997-06-04

The short answer, according to Guns, Germs and Steel, is that it had the benefit of greater diversity, and that this diversity was the gift of geography.  More kinds of domesticated plants and  more kinds of domesticated large animals were available across Eurasia.  More kinds of food meant more people, thus more kinds of diseases (which other peoples weren't immune to) and also more new ideas.

As a teacher, I have insisted that my high school freshmen all read Ender's Game.  The fast pace and excellent character development engage the students and lead them toward discussion of serious issues, like how we treat those who are &quot;different&quot; and the ultimate goals and purposes of education.  Speaker for the Dead has a different focus, and perhaps a different audience.  Although many of my students have read it because they so loved Ender's Game, not many were ready for its sophistication.   Speaker for the Dead works for me in its treatment of two major issues.  The first of these, expressed through the interaction (and its disastrous results) between the piggies and the humans, has to do with cultural relationships and the arrogant assumptions often made by the dominant culture.  The humans function at a level of cultural blindness hard to understand through most of the novel, and that blindness has tragic consequences.   The second issue I love in this book is the concept of the Speaker for the Dead, the role that Ender Wiggin has taken on in his adulthood.  A Speaker's job consists of traveling to places he is called to &quot;speak&quot; the life of someone who has died.  These itinerant Speakers come to the person's life completely objectively, and thus they are able to speak the truth about that person--good and bad.  The speaker helps the community deal with the person's death by allowing them to see that person completely; all the person's facets, foibles, and fortes are displayed.  I found myself thinking that if mopre people read this book, we might have a whole new funereal ritual to deal with.    In short, while of a completely different tone than Ender's Game, Speaker for the Dead brings up some important issues, and it is well worth the time spent in reading it.  Invest several days in this book; it deserves them.  --Prudence Plunkett (Prudence_Plunkett@breadnet.middlebury.edu)	1997-06-05

Then what was the purpose? how much really happened? the anger could be there, but the situations???????  I was confused. But Harper must have really met Boo and talked extensively or else why would she live the way she does?

Jon Krakauer has written an intimate and sincere account of Christopher McCandless'  short-lived journey. The book, which is marked along the way with letters and diary entries of McCandless or &quot;Alexandra Supertramp&quot;, provides honest insight into the young man's hopes and dreams.  McCandless, seemingly comtemptous of his well-to-do roots,  chose to abandon family and society to pursue a path that he believed was the basis for the existence of the human spirit - the passion  for adventure.  His journey into the wild began in June 1990.  He started in Atlanta and passed through Houston, Detrital Wash, Grand Junction, Carthage, Cut Bank, Seattle, Astoria, Orick, Dawson Creek. He reached Alaska in April 1992. Four months later, his decomposed body was found in an abandoned bus there.  Krakauer has threaded together a compelling read, gathering information from McCandless' family and the people McCandless met along the way and whom were ultimately left with deep-lasting good impressions of a kid who was brave enough to heed the call of the wild.  Some Alaskan hunters, however, said McCandless was a naive kid who showed inadequate respect for the forces of nature and thus suffered the consequences.   I leave with you excerpts from a letter that McCandless wrote:  &quot;So many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security, conformity and conservatism, all of which may appear to give one peace of mind, but in reality nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future. The basic core of a man's living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each dayto have a new and different sun.&quot	1997-06-07

As I read the reviews of those who hated this story, I found myself thinking over and over, &quot;You just don't get it.&quot; Wrapped in what looks on the surface to be yet another trite love story, is a deep and complex telling of a tale of sacrifice. For those who read it in an hour, I say, &quot;Go back and read it again; you missed the point.&quot; In your haste, you read the words, but ignored the message. In today's society of instant gratification, you saw a small book and decided it required an equally small amount of dedication to reading it and truly listening to what it had to say. Try again, but this time devote a bit more effort to looking beyond the love story between these two characters and feel the heart of Waller's lessons. Life and love are never easy, the most perfect things sometimes come at inopportune times, and sacrifices are made in error that preserve the order of things in some lives while leaving the door on other lives opened but without closure. It is not surprising to me that most people would misinterpret this novel, that they would see only the love story that lies on the surface and ignore the depth of what lies beneath. Most people have never loved in the way that Waller writes about, so to them this will always remain just a &quot;Harlequin romance.&quot; But for those of you out there who have loved someone you shouldn't have at a time that wasn't right, this book will make you understand that what you did wasn't a sin. It was a gift. And maybe it will make you rethink your decision to live that life of quiet desperation doing what you should do for the sake of your family, and instead pack your bag and run with your &quot;Robert Kincaid,&quot; run hard and fast and without stopping even to take a breath.

I flung the book away in frustration about halfway through, a couple of years ago.  I am Indian myself, and I must say that in the years since the book was published, it has received uniformly lukewarm reviews in Seth's home country. Perhaps it is because while all the rich detail, the food, the languages, the social systems seem incredibly invigorating reading to the outsider, an Indian is left with the nagging feeling: 'so what's new?'.  Now that I have read it fully for the second time with far fewer epic expectations, I found a zesty, interesting page-turner, which is quite successful in trying to grapple with the huge complexities of Indian life in a comprehensible and fun manner.  Much of the book could in fact well be set in the 90s, since so much in India remains unchanged.  The book is definitely worth a read and Vikram Seth is an enormously talented wordsmith, but classic it certainly is not.

Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card combines the best of Science Fiction with a riviting message about the human survival instinct.  The book follows Ender, a child genious and an outcast from society, through early childhood and on through the torments of the battle school.  He is in a society threatened by an alien race called the 'Buggers'. From the begining of the novel, the reader is made aware that Ender is considered the last hope for humanity. <br /> Card writes the book as though telling a wonderful story of Compassion in the face of complete evil. I feel that this novel should be required reading for anyone who considers himself human. you may find that some of the situations that Ender Wiggen goes through are not all that foriegn and that Card portrays society more accurately than most.	1997-06-09

Look elsewhere	While this book is well written, it should be looked upon as a history and not as a formula for success. It offers more in the soft-and-feeling area than in something that can be taken to the  bank. It does throw light on how well placed and open Grove is inside his business, and that should be a call to arms for all CEOs.  I found the book called Value Migration printed by the Harvard Business School more systematic on finding your edge competitors.  In fact there are a number of books on this same topic which are more useful.  I also think Grove's reason for the unseating of DEC, etc. from pre-eminent position leaves one questioning. I can't see a difference between Intel and Microsoft (Wintel) and DEC: Microsoft wants to own everything except the hardware (which it has given to Intel) and the applications,  which for the most are specific to a company and industry. This seems like DEC, except it wanted the hardware as well.  My own experience is that DEC had just plain bad marketing, and you need only look at the Alpha debacle to see the truth	1997-06-09

These words were spoken about another generation,  a group of young people who, after World War I, were feeling disconnected from the rest of the world.       <br />Many of them were living in Europe, living the &quot;expatriate&quot; life.  That meant they lived from meal to meal on borrowed money trying to develop an artistic lifestyle thousands of miles from everything and everyone they grew up knowing.    <br /> Just a few years ago, Seattle was a kind of Mecca among east coast Generation Xers.  Everyone I went to college with envisioned Seattle as the place where we could be ourselves.  Of course, we hadn't really defined who that was yet, and none of us had been there.  Yet, somehow, we knew that Seattle was the place to be.    <br /> Paris was the place to be for the original lost generation and Ernest Hemingway became one of that city's most celebrated adopted sons.  His semi-autobiographical novel The Sun Also Rises follows a group of young people trying to find themselves after World War I.     <br /> Jake Barnes, the main character, is a veteran with an unfortunate war wound which puts a damper on his dating life.  Lady Brett Ashley is the woman who loves him, and whom he loves, but also the woman he cannot have.  They are surrounded by a cast of painters, writers, editors, drunks, and a bullfighter named Pedro Romero.    <br /> Romero becomes the linchpin of the story.  Jake, Brett, and friends head off to Pamplona, Spain for the running of the bulls and the festival of San Fermin.  Jake is a bit of an aficionado of la corrida de toros and looks forward to initiating his less experienced friends.      <br />He did not anticipate, however, Lady Brett.  Brett is the female equivalent of a womanizer.  When she meets Romero, sparks fly and Jake is put into the uncomfortable position of acting as a go-between for the woman he loves and another man.     <br /> When the novel comes to a close, Jake is still lost, but is closer to finding himself.  The problem is he's not sure he likes himself. Maybe he should go to Seattle, have a mocha, and try to chill out  . . . or whatever.	1997-06-09

This is the pinnacle of character writing, this book is the definition of Pathos.<br />  I've read every review here (took over 1 hour) and I have seen 2 groups of negative comments: <br /> 1. This is not hard scifi.   I know this.  It isn't SUPPOSED to be.  I've read a LOT of scifi, and believe me, Card knew what he was doing.  He didn't want you to be questioning his suppositions in the science world.  He brings in a few concepts to catch your attention but doesn't give you enough to DISTRACT from the flawless tale.  Hard core scifi is great stuff...but as a whole I find the characters there shallow, merely a vessel for a new scientific idea.  Here the characters are real, powerful, and beautiful.<br />  2. How can a child be so smart: Anyone who can't suspend their belief the little tiny bit that it requires to follow the story line isn't a reader, they are a critic, and not a very good one.  Ender is a genius, but he IS a child, or he wouldn't be put in the situation he was in.  What the critics are missing here is that Ender LOSES the game, and spends the next 3000 years trying to pay for that loss.  His innocence is his downfall.  I've known children that are introspective...not all are hyperactive sugar-bombs, some struggle just to gain acceptance in their own family.  He was born a &quot;third&quot; you may remember, and was subject to intense scrutiny his entire existence......how would you have behaved as a child?  I think you would have grown up in an awful hurry.<br />  Anyway....I am a hard core scifi fan.  I've read every book I've ever heard of from Clarke, Niven, Asimov.....these Scifi giants are fabulous and they help us shape our vision of the future.<br />  Card is a storyteller.  He doesn't base his books on the science.  He bases them on the character.  That's how the art works.  That's WHY the art works.  If you want pure science, pick up an engineering book.  Most people read for the thrill of the characters.<br />  Sure, it can be fun to calculate the testile strength of Ringworld &lt;yawn&gt; if you're an engineer....but if you're a human, this is the best book you will EVER read.<br />  Anyone who makes it this far down the review list would be on chapter 7 by now.  :)  Just go get the book, see for yourself.  Or maybe that advanced quantum physics book is more your style.  I guarantee you'll love one of them.<br />  PS I've bought ender's game 23 times, and given it away 22 times.  When someone asks me why I write SciFi, I give them a copy. Its become a textbook for me now.<br />  If I ever get to meet OSC, I'm going to shake his hand and tell him what an impact he has had on me as a Reader and as a Writer.  I'm sure he gets it daily, but when you're that good....well I guess it just goes with the territory.  <br />  Long story short......just go buy the book.

This, Dick's most famous book, is definitely NOT what you think it is going to be if you are picking it up after seeing the movie.  In fact, even if you have never heard of the movie, it is probably not what you are thinking it is going to be.  The book is a maze of questions and theories; especially exploring the familiar Dickian theme of identity.  (am I real, or manufactured?  Are my memories real, or programmed?  Are YOU real?) The story of the replicant (androids who mirror humans and often exceed them, but have a very short lifespan) hunter Deckard is fast, often funny (see the mood machine in the first chapter) and always intriguing.  He seems to have rushed his writing in a few places.  And at times I could tell he was keeping his concept down for the enjoyment of sci-fi readers.  Still, a good place to start with Dick, and one of the fastest reads you'll encounter	1997-06-10

Take away all the recycled irritants from &quot;Ender's Game&quot; -- the characters who exist only to tell us how wonderful the hero is, the judgemental self-righteousness masquerading as Compassion (with a capital C, yes), the lead character who's always better at everything than the experts, and (of course) gallons and gallons of self-pity, Ender's mother's-milk, and &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; still has at its core the mark of a bad novel -- the Big Secret that any idiot can guess before Chapter 1 is over.

Billions of people on the Web, and not _one_ has a single idea, except for Ender's siblings.  But that's the pattern of the book, a book that makes no attempt to describe the contentiousness or complexities of real life.<br /> Ender, the hero, is no more a character than, say, James Bond -- Ender always wins, always bests every obstacle, defeats every enemy, shames every teacher, with a mininum of effort.  Other characters exist only to extol or mirror his greatness; the handful who don't admit to his superiority are easily disposed of.  There's an almost pornographic feel to the final chapter, in which Ender founds a new space colony, saves the alien race he thought he had single-handedly destroyed, and invents a new religion(!), all the while wallowing in the self-pity that started at page 2 and never stopped.<br />  I would give this the lowest grade possible but for two factors -- Card is a facile, easy-to-read writer, and the book might do some good to bright pre-teen boys who aren't getting much support from their environment.  Of course, &quot;Playboy&quot; might too, but it isn't art either.  Not recommended for adults at all.	1997-06-10

Poe, Christie, Doyle and many others receive homage within this story, which connects them with the long line of romance dating to Dumas and beyond. Borges and Eco are also included, suggesting that the gap between literary and genre is an artificial construct. The novel toys with the &quot;highbrow&quot; concepts of contemporary literary theory in establishing a tantalizing contest between reader and author that mirrors the contest between hero Lucas Corso and the mysterious figure(s) behind the novel's events. The novel delights in old books and playfully uses time-honored techniques from alluded-to works that still manage to challenge how we read and what we expect out of a story. Like the mysterious members of the Club Dumas, &quot;sophisticated&quot; readers are given the opportunity to savor an &quot;escapist&quot; fiction without the negative connotations usually associated with that term.  A rare breed, The Club Dumas is a page-turner that will have you pondering it long after you've turned the last page.	1997-06-11

There's a clear division in the beginning, between Sophie's life and the text of the letters she's receiving. Here, I admit I was reading the book more for the Sophie part than the philosophy. This changed, however. Truth is, there's not much to the character of Sophie. After awhile, her part of the dialogues between her and the teacher became nothing but mindless prompts. What are her interests? She goes camping, once, and she has one friend, but other than that, she hardly has an identity.       Gaarder follows the history of philosophy chronologically, and does an excellent job of illustrating how it develops over the centuries. Contrary to first approach, I began reading for the philosophical parts of the book rather than for Sophie. Or Hilde. (There's not much to Hilde, either.) Gaarder's characters are shamefully underdeveloped, but he makes up for this with the philosophy, which he presents with pure genius. In the second half of the book, the focus is on individual philosophers, rather than philosophy as a historical/intellectual movement. The chapters devoted to Democritus, Darwin, Kant, Hegel, Sartre, and particularly Sren Kierkegaard, are fascinating.       The ending to &quot;Sophie's World&quot; was outrageous. I think that this, in addition to the faceless characters, is the main drawback of the book. In my opinion, there's a lot of buildup throughout the book that goes to waste. Perhaps I didn't fully comprehend what was going on. Then again, something tells me that even if I did completely understand the ending, it would be inconsequential anyway.       My recommendation? Do not read this book if you are looking for a literary masterpiece. You must read this book from a philosophical point of view. Whether you know much about philosophy or not doesn't matter - it serves well as an introduction to the subject, or simply presents a new way to look at philosophy for the more learnd. I even recommended it to my religion instructor, a PhD in philosophy. I think that it's worth the time, because it's something unique and different; unlike any book you've ever read.	1997-06-12

Incredibly well-written, it take the reader not only on a journey of the life of Chris McCandless, but others like him, and the author himself.  In many ways it will allow you to better understand yourself, and a part of the human mind that many of us bury.  The life of Chris McCandless is not only interesting and bewildering, but incredibly brave and respectful; and at the same time, very creepy, with some passages sending chills down your spine.

With some books you can get a feeling of where the book is going, what will happen, who will die, so on.  With a Game of Thrones, this does not happen.  From the first page, you are thrown into a maelstrom of events and people, all going in different directions.  Threads of people and events weave around other threads, and you never know when or if they will end.  Martin never takes the easy way out, never taking the road most traveled.  This book is truly a unique experience and a read worthy of any lover of fantasy who has found things lacking in other books.  There is nothing lacking in this book.  Wait, yes there is.

Humour is not an easy  genre. It is much easier to write a tearful masterpiece than a joyous one, humoristic but not vulgar. I really find few   allegedly humorous books that lived up my expectations. This did.<br /> The plot is simple and common to most of the Wodehouse's books featuring the   immortal Bertram-Jeeves pair: Bertram Wooster is    a young rich englishman with an almost genial butler Jeeves. Bertram has plenty of pretty absurd   relatives (expecially aunts, see also the great:   &quot;Aunts are not gentemen&quot;) and get always involved   in funny troubles. At the end, only the help of Jeeves' oversized brain can lead to the expected   happy end. <br /> I know, this resume sounds just plain stupid (don't hate me). But the book  is better than   this. The strengh of Wodehouse is in the wonderful   use of the language. Maybe you cant help laughing   only twice reading the book, but every single line   put a cherub-like smile on your face. (My wife,   for instance, can always guess when I'm reading   Wodehouse.) <br />   I will add only 2 comments.<br /> 1) Wodehouse had written several books with Bertram and Jeeves, so if you like   this one you have found a mine of joy for the darkest spots of your life.<br />   2) If english (or american...) is not your native language, then this book is both a challenge and a reward.

I don't think I've felt this personally about fictional characters since I was 12 and reading The Lord of the Rings.  However, it _is_ proving to be inconvenient to be hopelessly in love with a figment of somebody else's imagination- not to mention difficult to explain to my husband! I was lucky enough to find the series just after Voyager was published, so I didn't have to suffer withdrawal that time around, but it will be a long dry spell before the next tome comes out- I'm not even going to think about how long it will be until the last one.  The only other books that come close to being so engaging and absorbing are (some of) Laura Kinsale's; with the Outlandish books one has the added advantage of getting to experience the whole scope of Claire and Jamie's lives together, not just the falling-in-love and the first few obstacles. I would highly recommend these books to anyone who hasn't read them yet; unless of course you have the willpower to wait another 6 years or so to spare yourself what will surely be a frustrating wait to get all the answers! :	1997-06-13

This CD set is a must have for any Les Mis fan's collection. It is, in my opinion, the closest to a 'dream cast' recording that has been released on CD thus far. Colm Wilkinson is amazing as Valjean, outdoing his previous performances on both the Broadway and London cast albums (again, in my opinion) Philip Quast is incredible as Javert; he captures the character perfectly. Lea Salonga as Eponine and Ruthie Henshall as Fantine are fabulous as well - by far my favorites in their respective roles over all others who have been released in recording. Although several songs are cut short or edited, this is definitely a worthwhile purchase.

My father searched for years to find this book, having read a review of it long ago.  When it was published again, my father took advantage and spent the better part of a year passing copies of this book along to many fortunate individuals like myself. (You must understand that my father is not the kind of man who would give away books that he LOVES.)  My copy alone has passed through the hands of another 10 people.  That fact alone is an incredibly favorable review.  There is something fundamentally heartbreaking and awe-inspiring in this tale.  While reading it in the comfort of your home, it is hard to imagine the initial thrill of fear in escape, the consuming thirst of the Gobi desert, and the intense cold of the Himalayas.  To have endured so much so that when they came across the yeti, its peculiar existence atop frigid mountains was not as extrodinary when compared to the plight of their own trek, even to the reader.  The simple carnal desire for survival propelled them (and us) past a creature of legend and on into India.  So few humans have lived to tell of an experience of that magnitude.  Therefore, how many of us can truly comprehend it or express our empathy without paling in comparison?  All I can do is to continue to pass this book along.  I am online to purchase a copy for my new in-laws.  That is the best form of compliment I can think of.	1997-06-14

Bryson's book was meant for consumption during the inevitable airport delays and seems to comfortably fit in with those who prefer to read USA Today and spend a couple of hours each evening glued to the tube. <br /> I found the most interesting parts of the book to be when Bryson talked about his family, his own community, and, yes, Mr. Morrisey the milkman.  Since this was written nearly a decade ago, some of his observational wit would be considered a tad politically incorrect these days.  I would have liked to have seen the author spend a little time in some of the &quot;forgettable&quot; bergs along his travels in an attempt to probe deeper into why these people are where they are and do what they do.  The glossing over, with distain of places like Cripple Creek and Wiscasset, caused me endless disspointment throughout the book.  <br />  Having lived as an expat in Europe, Asia and the Middle East for 14 years, and originally coming from the Midwest myself, I did identify with Bryson's &quot;stranger in my own land&quot; sentiments.  There is considerable truth to the term of reverse culture shock and this book's strength lies in Bryson's repeated examples of an expat's &quot;selected recollections&quot; when comparing home to his/her home away from home.  <br />  Put this book in your briefcase or carry-on bag.

Ray Bradbury's stories always manage to pierce through into a deep sense of longing. They leave you unsatisfied (because they do come to an end) yet, at the same time, filled with pleasure at the rightness of just how he does it (Dark They Were and Golden-Eyed, for example).   Something Wicked This Way Comes is no different. The struggle between evil for the possession of the boys' souls and the love, bravery, and sacrifice elicited from Will and his dad just knocks you out.  The increasing pace, the looming threat, and the ever more clearly defined personal consequences of squarely facing it, all rachet up the tension in perfect phase--you'll know it when you get to that special chapter.

His one side is well-mannered, charming and witty, while his other face is ruthless, sly and money-driven. In Part One, &quot;The Old Buccaneer&quot;, the strange new pirate pays Jim Hawkins a gold piece daily &quot;to watch out for a one-legged man hobbling down the street.&quot;  This is truly good, almost humorous, foreshadowing.

REBECCA is the underlying novel for the Academy Award winning Hitchock classic movie and a recent Masterpiece Theater entry.  REBECCA is a story seen through the eyes of a young girl who we only know by name as the second Mrs. DeWinter.  She meets the charming, dashing and much older Maxim DeWinter in the South of France while she is employed as a paid companion.  After a whirlwind romance they marry and he wisks her off to his hom e in Cornwall:  Manderley.  Manderley really is the main character of this gothic romance.  The girl projects all of the insecurities brought on by youth and inexperience onto Manderley and the title character Rebecca.  The most enjoyable part for me of reading REBECCA is the description of the house and grounds, the dishes and the bushes.  Maybe Martha Stewart read REBECCA in her formative years.  Daphne Du Maurier departs from the classic &quot;whodunit&quot; and is more concerned with the character of the place and the people involved.  She shows us magnificiently how perception and reality can be almost diametrically opposed at times and the consequences of our often wrongheaded but very natural assumptions about other people and their motives.

Anyone who has spent time in the part of the world Garland describes knows that Thais are more than drug-running killers or corrupt policemen, and the &quot;backpacker&quot; world he describes is not peopled with strung-out hippies with no connection to a &quot;real world&quot; -- the world of Kho Sahn Road in Bangkok and the islands of Koh Samui and Koh Phagnan -- that Garland's characters deride.  Garland begins to delve into the unique psychology and drive of the young traveler, then abandons that far more interesting line of inquiry in favor of a paranoid and not very sophisticated thriller with not much punch.  Nevertheless, the book is imaginative in it's structure and narrative and the protagonist Richard, a young Brit, runs the emotional gauntlet from blissed out escapism to shear terror.  Garland's book could have been great but the world he describes deserves more subtle descriptive and the lack of character development - most of the supporting players are mere carictitures of humans (which Garland himself tweaks with imagainative nicknames like Daffy and Bugs) - leaves the conclusion of the story flat and unsatisfying.  Still, Garland has a way with dialogue and the tale can be a fun ride if you don't expect too much	1997-06-18

I loved it so much it's kind of difficult to go back to it once more for fear of being disappointed. The evocative reminiscing of childhood adventure simply supercedes any of King's horror writings. As in The Body, King clearly clicks when relating the spirit of adventure, something we seem to lose as we grow older. It goes well beyond its premise of Good versus Evil. It is all about the amazing boldness and courage that only children can ever understand. The world of &quot;It&quot; is naive innocence. It is a world we all yearn for now we are old.  The master of the Horror genre undersells himself in his pursuit of cheap thrills.

LOOK.  This isn't some kitschy happy-ending novel.  It's a PERSON'S TRUE LIFE STORY.  If you wanted an exciting, glamorous life, go read some dumb Danielle Steel.  McCourt spent 20 years living the life portrayed in this book.  If you want to enjoy it for what it is, the mere hours you will spend entwined in his story will put a lump in your throat, but it is probably nothing compared to what McCourt went through in his own mind putting it on paper.

The reader of this work is given a taste of its  ideological bent upon reading the forward by  Senator Strom Thurmond. Thurmond's forward praises  Lt. Col. Corso's impeccable military credentials   without discussing the books premise - that is that  the Cold War was won in no small part due to the  successful reverse engineering of Alien artifacts  recovered at the Roswell crash site in 1947.    Corso's book is replete with generalizations   regarding the so-called Alien technology found at  Rozwell; however, he offers nothing more than   unsupported generalizations.  The various appendices   in the book are disjointed and are unrelated to the  book's premise that the U.S. Military and Industry  used Alien technology in developing key weapons   systems as SDI, the Stealth Bomber, lasers, etc.    It appears that the appendices were added as  fillers.  They add nothing and confirm less.    Even more puzzeling than the disjointed appendices  are the photo inserts.  I mean what do photographs  of the author's son playing with a robot he has built  and Corso shaking hands with US Officers during his  visit as Inspector General have to do with Alien  encounters, Rozwell or UFO's?  Again their   insertion suggests filler.  The other photo   insertions illustrating alleged UFO encounters  offer nothing new and depict the popular photos  familar in many UFO publications.  Considering  Corso's access to confidential files and his  reference to the &quot;Nut File,&quot; (his term for the  Rozwell documents), one would expect exciting new  disclosures.    A question that Corso never addresses in the book   is why has he now come forward to discuss the   so-called cover-up?  One can suspect that he  wishes to cash-in on the 50th anniversary fervor.  I know he &quot;hooked&quot; me.    The book's release date does little to deminish   this motive.    The books ending is also puzzeling.  Who is the  mysterious person (presumably Russian)speaking   with Corso and why is it there?Throughout his book,Corso defends the government's  right to &quot;lie&quot; for the overall good of the nation.  Is this book full disclosure or another attempt at  disinformation?  Considering the lack of documentaion  and official citations, I am inclined to believe  the latter.	1997-06-22

Dick once said. It's a pity, as most people would get really impressed at how much literary consistency a book like &quot;Do androids dream of electric sheep?&quot; has in its 224 pages. <br />The author, Philip K. Dick, is known as one of most prolific writers in modern American literature. Compared with Borges by the also SF writer Ursula K. Leguin, and with Kafka by the cartoonist Art Spiegelman, K. Dick has a unique way of presenting his reality. The singular of the word reality maybe is not the best way to represent K. Dick's writings. Realities, shifting unstable realities, are more close to what K. Dick accomplishes with his books, never leaving the reader on a safe ground. <br />&quot;Do androids dream of electric sheep?&quot; is a good example of Mr. Dick ability. The main plot is the story of a cop specialized in killing runaway androids, locked in an empty earth were all smart people had already set sail for space colonies, and starting to feel strange about his job. Rick Deckard, the cop, is a good man, who's biggest dream is to have a REAL animal, flesh and blood, which is very expensive in a world were everything have been replaced by metal and circuits.   <br /> This story is a perfect scenario for K. Dick show us how volatile is our notion of real. As the book goes, he twists around everything that he himself gave as certain in the beginning. Deckard MAY be an android implanted with memories of somebody else, Mercer, the modern equivalent of Jesus, MAY be a god or a fake, Isidore, a retard, MAY be the only one to understand the truth of this world. All this &quot;mays&quot;, together with a precise and hard way of writing, makes &quot;Do androids...&quot; a test for your notion of reality. But, in nowadays,  who really has a precise notion of reality?  <br />For all that, and much more, &quot;...of electric sheep?&quot; is a burst of creative writing, as good as any really inventive book, anywhere and anytime, not just a &quot;good SF book&quot;. I was going to say that &quot;Do androids dream of electric sheep?&quot; is a &quot;modern classic&quot;, but I gave up. There is nothing of classic in this book, and everything of modern. K. Dick's style is absolutely new, absolutely tuned with our days. The best is to call it, perhaps, a &quot;modern modern book&quot;.	1997-06-22

BUT, what this book is very good at is teaching the theory and application of the Theory of Constraints in a conversational tone.  There's no equations and occasionally it uses pictures to make its points.  The format of a novel is a convention that allows the reader to slip through the text as if they were given in lecture style, rather than in the form of a textbook.  A much easier way to take material that can be pretty esoteric.  And the esoterica problem is handled by introducing several characters with \\"real world\\" problems that are analyzed throughout the book.  The targeted level appears to be college undergraduate or even advanced high school, which is to say it is easy reading aimed at getting the concepts across without any oddball jargon.            The point of the story is how Theory of Constraints, and other management theories such as TQM, Continuous Quality Improvement, and use of metrics can be applied with good effect to the Project Management world as well as to the Production and Manufacturing worlds.  Critical Path Method is stressed as the key tool to examining and exposing the problems that will be encountered, and the book then describes the management attitude and method changes that should be adopted to improve the overall effectiveness of a project team, and by extension, the whole organization.          This will never be a book you'll want to see made into a major Hollywood motion picture, but if you always wanted to understand and apply Theory of Constraints to your business practices, this is the painless way to sit through several lectures on the subject.  You'll walk away with a few very useful tools and a map to the larger pitfalls you'll encounter (or may already BE encountering!) on your way to strengthening your organization.     I got through it in about 14 hours easy reading, with frequent interruptions.  If its something you need, its definitely worth doing.	1997-06-24

The setting has switched abruptly from Scotland in the midst of a rising to the American colonies on the brink of revolution.  With the change of setting, though, the style of this fourth book in the series has also changed.  Outlander, Dragonfly, and Voyager all had huge complex plots filled with feeling, excitement, and grandeur, and they were written with intelligence; altogether, they left me awed.  Drums, though, seems more like a novel composed of random ideas thrown together and hastily shaped into some semblance of a complete story, without the necessary links between each new idea.  Also, the characters aren't as well developed and aren't as easily likable--Brianna seems spoilt and unforgiving, Jamie overprotective and stern, without much in common with the boyish, perceptive openly-honest man he was before.  It's still written with the same humor and distinct &quot;Gabaldon voice,&quot; though, so it's anything but a flop. Just one piece of advice for prospective Outlandish readers--don't let Drums be the first book in this series that you read	1997-06-28

When I first picked it up, I thought, &quot;Why would I want to read the story of such an obvious loser like Chris McCandless?&quot; I ended up reading it in a single sitting. <br /> From the moment McCandless blasts out of Atlanta 'til his final hours in Alaska, the reader rides shotgun, never truly prepared for the next stop. Krakauer exposes some of the most forbidding and exhilarating settings America has to offer, using the McCandless story as a frame for describing and detailing landscapes that most Americans experience only as roadside blur if they experience them at all. <br /> McCandless is posthumously fortunate to have such a skillful and sensitive author tell his tale. Krakauer is establishing himself in the great American tradition of Muir, Thoreau, and Abbey. I recommend this book without reservation	1997-06-28
US	52164732	RAAXE1BO6LJEY	0800196341	175290836	Hamlet [VHS]	Video	5	4	5	N	Y	What a piece of work is Hamlet!	I have been fascinated by Shakespeare's &quot;Hamlet&quot; ever since I first saw a film version of it in High School back in the early 1980s. Since then, I have read the play many times and I have watched every version of &quot;Hamlet&quot; that I have been able to see.  I think that Branagh's version of &quot;Hamlet&quot; is by far the best adaptation of the play I have ever seen.  Branagh's Hamlet was witty, sarcastic, emotionally volatile and complex, and yet he was still the charismatic, intelligent and capable Prince that might have been a great King had his uncle not usurped the crown.<br />  Best of all, Branagh's &quot;Hamlet&quot; was filmed in beautiful 70mm format, with bright colors and stately sets that was a glorious contrast to the tradition of filming Hamlet with dark, brooding sets dominated by black and somber earth tones.  Branagh daringly decided to set the play in a impressionistic 19th Century setting that was reminiscent of the life-style that must have been led by the great royal houses of Europe during that era.  Branagh's decision to set the film in the 19th Century brought the action close enough to us in history that we could relate to it, but kept it far enough away that the Elizabethan language did not seem out of place.<br />  Branagh's version of the play is unique in that it is a film of the **complete** text written by Shakespeare.  However, Branagh did not simply film the existing text as written by the Bard, he brings the text to life by effectively using flashbacks and other visuals to dramatically show us details that would not be possible to show on the stage.  His effective use of flashbacks fleshes out the relationships between the characters before the main action of the play. In flashbacks, we see interaction between Claudius and Gertrude that suggests she may have unfaithful to her husband before his death.  We also see a couple of tastefully sexy scenes of Ophelia and Hamlet in bed that shows us that their relationship was indeed a passionate love affair. This makes Hamlet's brutal treatment of Ophelia during the &quot;get thee to a nunnery&quot; scene even more cruel, but, as a result, Ophelia's subsequent descent into madness makes much more sense.<br />  The full text version is almost 4 hours long, but by filming it, Branagh wisely preserves the subtleties of the play that Olivier's Academy Award-winning version eviscerated.  Olivier removed or greatly reduced many characters' lines. He completely edited out Fortinbras, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and the English Ambassador, thus removing the complex political and military situation that culminates in the invasion of Elsinore by Fortinbras at the end of Act V.  Olivier also dramatically reduced the lines spoken by Gertrude and Claudius.  Claudius becomes a cardboard villain and Gertrude a vain and shallow woman.  Olivier thus converted Shakespeare's subtle and complex play about a Prince driven almost to madness by grief and indecision into a shallow play about a self-obsessed Prince who has strong Oedipal feelings for his mother.<br />  Thus, Branagh's full text version is a celebration of and an homage to the most quoted and most famous play in the English language.  Despite it's length, I was completely enthralled and entertained throughout its full, four-hour length. I think it is the finest film adaptation of a Shakespearian play ever produced.  ENDship was indeed a passionate love affair. This makes Hamlet's brutal treatment of Ophelia during the &quot;get thee to a nunnery&quot; scene even more cruel, but, as a result, Ophelia's subsequent descent into madness makes much more sense.   <br />   The full text version is almost 4 hours long, but by filming it, Branagh wisely preserves the subtleties of the play that Olivier's Academy Award-winning version eviscerated.  Olivier removed or greatly reduced many characters' lines. He completely edited out Fortinbras, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and the English Ambassador, thus removing the complex political and military situation that culminates in the invasion of Elsinore by Fortinbras at the end of Act V.  Olivier also dramatically reduced the lines spoken by Gertrude and Claudius.  Claudius becomes a cardboard villain and Gertrude a vain and shallow woman.  Olivier thus converted Shakespeare's subtle and complex play about a Prince driven almost to madness by grief and indecision into a shallow play about a self-obsessed Prince who has strong Oedipal feelings for his mother.   <br />   Thus, Branagh's full text version is a celebration of and an homage to the most quoted and most famous play in the English language.  Despite it's length, I was completely enthralled and entertained throughout its full, four-hour length. I think it is the finest film adaptation of a Shakespearian play ever produced.  END	1997-06-29

The legal insand outs and the negotiations on all levels, including personal and public, were fascinating and educational.  The ending really didn't suprise me as much as it should have because I was expecting something to happen pages before.

I found the book tedious, dramatically different in style than the first 3 and if it weren't the 4th of 6 books, I wouldn't have bothered to finish it.

Okay, I'm really sorry about not giving this book a very good rating. But while Asimov's style never seemed dated, some of the ideas presented in _Prelude to Foundation_ are just plain silly. Such as the ridiculous shades of color worn on Imperial Trantor, or the Mycongenians who shave their entire bodies and feel hair to be socially unacceptable. Stuff you'd find in the really bad science fiction of the pulp era...but that's not the worst part. The worst part is this book's plot is so thin (quite unlike every other book in the series) that Asimov soon turns it into nothing more than a tour of Trantor and a vehicle for some of the ideas he thought would be interesting in the Imperial era. Microfarms? Well, fine. Interesting perhaps. But did he need to devote five chapters of this book to showing us inside one of them? And did he need to use the climax of those five chapters to introduce us to the concept of a book with words that scroll up the page, that oh by the way happens to be the Mycogenian holy book, on which Hari and Dors spend another five chapters that lead them both nowhere at all? But I shouldn't bash the book too much, and you probably should read it anyway, since it leads directly into _Forward the Foundation_,which I loved as much as the original books written in the 1940s. If not for Forward the Foundation, I would've given this book a six. But you can't understand _Forward..._ without this, so read them both in the order they were published (which is actually what you should do for the whole series-read this after Foundation's Edge). You'll be glad about it, if not just for how great Forward the Foundation is	1997-06-30

A good read for a complete novice on the world of Wall Street and corporate America.  We benefit from the indepth research of the authors, clearly close to their subject, and, from their good journalism, as they know how to tell a story without losing the layman.  My subtitle for the book would be 'all I ever needed to know about LBOs'  -- the RJR Nabisco buyout is an excellent case study.  There's little too much extraneous detail on the characters -- it's distracting -- but perhaps that's an effort to give them some depth.  Indeed, it's a pity that many of the main protagonists are so reprehensible -- I found it hard to empathise with any of the characters.  And the story does leave the reader with a sense of disillusion on two points: the sheer waste of money and resources squandered for the sake of egos; and clearly, contacts (especially amongst the 'jocks') are as, if not more, important than diligence, competance or intelligence	1997-07-01

This book is perhaps even more overated than Robert Jordan's Wheel Of Time series. People say Jordan's better than Tolkien, but here people are saying this is the best book ever written. I liked it, but it's hardly up to that status. Keep in mind that this novel was written mostly A) to introduce Ender to Card's outline for Speaker for the Dead, B)to stop the comments by some parties that Card was championing the obliteration of an alien race (as it quite seemed he was in the original novella) and C) to introduce Card's concept of the Battle Room. How it came to involve Card's ideas about the Warsaw Pact and the Internet I don't know, but those subplots do keep the story from further becoming standard issue military SF.<br />What I believe draws readers to this books and makes them love it so is the narrative.I don't know what it is, but Card's descriptions of the book's scenes work wonders in terms of painting a picture.His minimal descriptions of the Battle School's claustrophobic hub as well as the rest of the story's locales and people allow one to visualize everything without being forced by the author to change what it might look like to that particular reader. That's one of Card's strength, describing the situation without describing the concrete looks of the situation. A hard thing to master, and a skill more writers should try their hand at. <br /> But some holes in the plot remain-why, after the near destruction of humanity, would the government allow parents to have only two children?Dosen't make sence. And why was Ender's army allowed to cheat by using the cable line in one of their battles? And why let the kids use so many tecniques that clearly use the walls as an advantage, when it was made perfectly clear that the only function of the walls in the battle room was to keep kids from careening into space Frank Poole-style (obviously there aren't wallsin space)? And while I can sort of believe a 6 year old could be as smart as Ender, it's hard to believe there would be enough of them to fill a giant battle school. But still, I liked the book, and finished the series. The other books I'd give nines, because they had original plots. Ender's game steals from _Starship Troopers_, among others, and still succeeds because of elements of psychology and strategy as well as ideas about the internet and politics	1997-07-01

But before I praise I will critisize it.  My first concern is why a patriot would break the silence?  That needs to be explained before I give it a 10.  Second:  I wish there would have been some sort of document that would at least hint at a coverup.  This book is great, if not for the ufo part then for the information Corso talks about the Cold war and just how dangerous it really was.  About half of the book discusses the dangers the KGB forced on us and how much they infiltrated the CIA.  He also goes on to talk about how the military fully distrusted the CIA for this reason.  Another aspect of this book is how all the technology he helped advance through the ship was already being developed.  In other words this ship didn't bring about all of our modern technology it hastened it introduction.    The first paragraph I wrote discusses my worries of this book.  The reasons that I tend ot believe in this starts with Strom Thurmand's forward.  If Thurmand wrote this forward not knowing the true reason then we can expect a lawsuit soon.  But I think thats unlikely.  I think thurmand knew why he was writing it and I glad he did because it adds a new glitch to the skeptic's point of view.  Why would a very respectible Senator, that has been able to retain office for decades, write a forward to such an outlandish book?  Also, Corso's  desciptions of other projects are very detailed in there acuracy of overall events.  One must realize that a man who is working with so many projects will not be able to retain any true detailed tech. specs. at that time and not 30 years later.  I hope more comes out of this.

Ham On Rye &amp; Women). Factotum is the bare bones of Bukow. It is his anger, his poverty, his screw-fests, fist-fights and booze without the Muse. It's documentary play by play versus inspired storytelling. Factotum (&amp; Post Office for that matter) is Bukow's brain recovering from his stint in the mad house trying to make sense of his life through words. Ham On Rye and Women are works where he has his proverbial shit together. The greater works are those where the documentary of a Drunk is elevated to that plane of alcoholic clarity, replacing Nihilisim with true Bukow character, superior surliness and &quot;i'll shit in my pants if I want to&quot; heroism. Yet, while Factotum may be crude in comparison to his other novels, it is still the brass tactics of the crappy boy Bukow we know so well.

But for some reason it has come to sit in Vonnegut's pantheon next to &quot;Slaughterhouse 5&quot; and &quot;Welcome to the Monkey House.&quot;  And again, it's not that it doesn't work; the odd little tale of island romance in the midst of revolution and the ultimate freezing element, ice-9 has plenty of terrific moments.  But ultimately, the book feels cold and clammy; where elsewhere Vonnegut contrasts the sad and the funny here he chooses to club you with pathos and neglect to explain much of anything.

The Great Ones are of course those who lived to tell the tale. They are Mellville and London and Hemingway. Adventurers will never die. But who is to say that the small victories or defeats in life are any less sublime than the Great conflicts and conquerings. Moby Dick and Call of the Wild, Into the Wild is not. It is about someone who was moved by the Great Spirit of Adventure. It is about someone who failed to survive the journey, but the chronicle of his attempt is worthy if for no other reason than to remind those of us with Nomad souls that the attempt must be made! Courage is the attempt, but behold! one must, we learn from Krakouer, not proceed without humility and wisdom, which aids survival so the attempt may be relished and  pondered. Adventurers who die adventuring perish in their Labor of Love, and this is not necessarily a bad or tragic thing as the Bourgiouse multitudes would have us believe. But, as Krakouer lets us see thorugh his commentary, the rewards of surviving the quest are almost as great as undertaking the quest itself	1997-07-02

There is also another story about a used car salesman losing his mind and wreaking havoc on the good times.  <br />  Of course, the novel is probably most famous for a character that comes in late in the novel, one Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.  Here, Vonnegut does his best Pirendello and confronts his world head on.

While the technical aspects of Card's sci-fi may be questionable, the psychology is brilliant.  How many gifted children have ever felt as though they were being forced to perform tricks, like animals on display, while knowing that the adults in control only had their position due to their age?  How much would such children relish the idea that through the anonymous Internet, they could take over the world?

US	51401944	R2GZC6SIP45K9E	0451191153	594264062	The Fountainhead	Books	5	0	0	N	N	A good book for philosophers and architects.	This book was indeed good, moving at least. However, there are points which I thought were montonous, unnecessary. There is a LONG speech given by the main character, Howard Roark, at the end of the book, mainly to consitute Rand's Ode To Objectivism. I mean, it was really long. If you want to learn Ojectivism, read any of the articles in Philosophy, Who Needs It. I also heard from a friend that there is an even longer speech, almost 50 pages, given by the main character in Atlas Shrugged. I don't think she had, at the point she wrote The Fountainhead, crafted her literary fiction skills perfectly yet.       As far as the philosophy presented in the book, it's rather straightforward and logical: you are fooled by your emotions, and it's an essential to moral survival to observe all things objectively, and to interpret your perceptions both rationally and logically. However, aside from the philosophical interpretation of the world, I disagree with Rand's political viewpoints, for reasons I won't enumerate here, simply to save space and to avoid putting you to sleep. In short, I think her epistemological and metaphysical philosophy contradicts her political.       The major downfall I see in Objectivism, demonstrated most clearly, is that it is a very dogmatic philosophy. Howard Roark's behavior seems logical, but it only goes to show how a real, stoic Objectivist behaves in an esoteric manner, holding their infallible logic aloof from all other 'common people'. With this I disagree, and again, I will not explacate here.       Overall, I give The Fountainhead two thumbs up, simply because it champions logic and reason, and those are two virtues that are entirely too scarce in the modern world. Also, being an aspiring architect, I had a great appreciation for the dominant theme chosen as the vehicle to deliver her message. It is a long book, but is one which you can move through at a good pace, if you understand the basic tenets of Objectivism and don't have a hard time with vocabulary.	1997-07-07

I give it a well-deserved 5/10.    The 5 is for the excellent writing and the breathtaking scholarship. I give Jared Diamond a U for analysis and idealogical cant . Starting from a promising and evocative premise   Mr. Diamond ends with a load of scholarly fudge so tainted by current fashionable thinking that  his great enterprise is very much diminished.    &quot;How is it that you white people have developed all this cargo and brought it to New Guinea and we black people have no cargo ?&quot;  The question is seminal. You have more than enough for yourselves and can bring it here and almost give it away; and we have none. Good cheap fish hooks; transistor radios, with batteries; small reliable electric generators; outboard motors that can pull against the fastest-rushing river currets; beautiful rifles that can bring down game at 300 meters; satellite television;   --- cargo, cargo, cargo.       Diamond doesn't see the poignancy of the question, he's too busy trying to show his humanity, political correctness and he is on his knees begging for forgiveness from our very insightful Yali. In this case at least, I agree with the author, this New Guinean has more intelligence than at least one Western academic.    Pizzaro was a bad boy. Pestilential vectors operating through close living with animals gave immunity to infection. Colonial loathsomeness. What has this got to do with cargo ?    Yali knows the truth: some civilizations are indeed better than others. Some are indeed more humane and more productive and allow more freedom for human development than others and only an intellectual caught in the web of his own nitpicking could believe otherwise. I do not doubt the innate intelligence of people everywhere, but tick-tack-ticking on a keyboard by a computer operator is several orders of magnitude from the accretion of science and multi-layered technologies that brought Western civilization from Euclid and Archimedes to a 4-million device computer chip.    But, but, you say, old Ed Wilson says its a good book. The great Paul Ehrlich the grandaddy of population studies, writes an approving note. As the old adage has it &quot;I'll write a blurb for your book but please don't make me read it.&quot;    Look, I don't want be mean about this but it seems the only way we can reform this kind of wrongheadedness is by refusing to participate. Take your mate to the driving range and shoot a pail of balls. Have dinner out at MacDonalds on me. Save your money in an S&amp;P Index based fund (currently paying 29%). This book was a shrewdly designed marketing plan by WWNorton: with the proliferation of multicultural courses in America's universities, there's almost a built-in sale of about 20,000 books and that will pay for the costs of production and then some. The rest is gravey.	1997-07-08

Dune is easily the most enthralling book I have ever read. Frank Herbert has managed to comment on many of our greatest worries (e.g. energy, religion, drugs), weaving them into a tapestry of interstellar proportions. The work takes place in the far future, where the politics of an entire universe is dependent upon a drug (Melange) which can be mined on only one planet: the desert Dune. Plot twists and intrigue abound in this greatest of Herbert's works. One small detail: if you read this work, be sure that you will read each of it's sequels (and there are five).

The Gaiman who wrote the Sandman series (among other graphic novels) - a dark, philisophical, and profoundly detailed version - and the Gaiman who writes books in a manor that causes a constant ring of Douglas Adams and Oscar Wilde. <br /> Not that this is a bad book in any way. It is entertaining, interesting, and generally great fun to read. Still, it's not the Neil Gaiman that Sandman alumni may expect; it is as if escaping to a pure text medium lifts his spirits.  <br />  The story - a average (or slightly below) man falls between the cracks to London Below and has adventures - is fun to read. The main character is easy to identify with, especially for anyone who has ever been completely out of their element.

Full of factual errors, gaping plot holes and an abundance of handy coincidences to carry along the action, it does appear to be a plot for a made-for-TV movie.

I would like to congratulate these two authors for their clear and entertaining way of presenting their findings.  The message they share in their book The Millionaire Next Door is one of hope and homey wisdom:  the 3,500,000 millionaire households in the US have certain common traits, and you can learn the &quot;secrets&quot; that they live by if you desire personal wealth.     What is notable is what didn't make the list of traits.  Expensive clothes, flashy cars, or high-consumption lifestyles are not the domain of the typical millionaire; they are more characteristic of the chronically over-extended!  A key distinction in this book is the difference between income and wealth.  Even people with a modest income, by following prudent principles, can enjoy great wealth over time.  On the other hand, top income-earners often spend their money as fast as they earn it, leaving them with few accumulated assets over the years.  This insight is particularly useful to young couples like my husband and I.   It is very comforting to know that one is really able to become financially independent and hence free in every sense of the word in this country.    A few puzzling things though: 1) I wonder about the totally neglected mention of the ethnic Chinese( or any other Asian group for that matter)successes in the book.  This calls into question the thoroughness of their research.  2) I was expecting an insighful elaboration of two of the denominators mentioned, ie, &quot;They are proficient in targeting market opportunities&quot; and &quot;They chose the right occupation.&quot;  The authors didn't really do justice to their assertions. 3) I  cannot but help wonder about the quality of life these ordinary millionaires have. While it is a great feeling to have much financial surplus, are theygenerally happy folks who have used their best potential in life.  Are they like Andrew Carnegie who devoted much of his life accumulating wealth and then spent the rest GIVING IT AWAY happily?	1997-07-10

Weber's second saga of Honor Harrington is a fitting follow-up to Basilisk Station.  After reading only the first two books in this series I'm hooked on Honor.  She is a  top-notch character: very likeable, highly capable, yet vulnerable.  One of the unique features of Weber's stories is a more detailed and more believable rationale for high-speed combat between space-ships.  Unlike most authors, he concerns himself with such things as speed, distance, acceleration, and detection of other ships and how these affect tactics and manuevering.  I haven't checked his math, but it all sounds plausible.  My only gripe with Weber so far is that, like Jerry Pournelle, he has a &quot;thing&quot; for monarchy.  Being a died-in-the-wool democrat and republican (both with lower-case letters) all this bowing and scraping to someone's son and heir sometimes rankles, but so far he has made the baddies, the People's Republic of Haven (the ultimate wellfare state) sound repulsive enough to keep me rooting for the Stellar Kingdom of Manticore.

I believe, like Major Jesse Marcel, he simply wanted to let the world in on what he knew before he passed away and the truth was possibly forever buried with him.      I found it rather strange that the Air Force decided to publish their book &quot;Case Closed&quot; just prior to the release of Colonel Corso's book.

Like a painter, Roy has painted in the tinydetails and rich language that make it a pleasure to read.  Despite having no linear structure, the book is still coherent and one ends with a feeling of having gone full circle.  The young Estha and Rahel and their relationship to everyone and everything around them are wonderfully real.  The lingustic innovations work in evoking an authentic 'child language'.  Roy also sticks faithfully to Kerala, not trying to oversimplify its complexities. Certain episodes are however, clumsily written, like the sexual abuse of Estha by the OrangeDrinkLemonDrink Man, almost as if the obligatory child sex abuse scene had to be inserted.  The older Estha and Rahel were, for me, completely unconvincing, their potentially explosive meeting after so many years is trite and stilted.  In fact, it is fortunate that most of the novel is set in the past.  It is almost as if the author has set up this wonderful story of a family falling apart (Ammu putting little Estha on the train is heartbreaking) and then doesn't know what to do with the adult brother and sister when they meet. Though the author protests that she wasn't thinking of an audience when she wrote (see her interview in amazon.com--why do authors have to pretend they are always in the throes of creative fervour and never think about things like dollar royalties and advances?) this is quite obviously written for a Western audience (why publish in New York otherwise?). That is why I think that while I as an Indian could identify with the children and with all the grown-ups around them, I found the grown up Rahel so unconvincing. I could not imagine too many Indian women living in jeans, studying for 'undergraduate' degrees (it is 'graduate' and 'post graduate', not undergraduate and graduate in India), marrying Americans on impulse and (another fashionable obligatory thing) getting divorced and drifting around-- 'alienated', unable to communicate with the people who brought them up. The older Estha is almost a caricature.  Something about these young Indian authors writing in English makes them evoke India wonderfully well, but they never manage to get into the skin of young adult Indians without falling into the mush of alienation, rootlessness and other fashionable claptrap. Those looking for a powerful larger vision will not find it in this book, this is definitely a well written book about the SMALL things.ound-- 'alienated', unable to communicate with the people who brought them up.

Everyday young men and women set out on similar quests for understanding in unforgiving rural and urban windernesses.  Most live to tell about it.  Some, like McCandless, don't. <br /> 207 pages is quite long for this story that could have been told effectively in a series of magazine articles or as part of a collection of shorter writings.

I felt as if I shared in Bryson's romp around Europe retracing his teenage interrail trip of the early 70's.  I also felt that he had many incisive comments and insights.  I laughed out loud on the subway at the many scenes that were so hilariously described.  Bryson has succeeded in taking the bar-room story into  book form  where he is the teller.  Unfortunately, the book does suffer from its on superficiality.  By the turn of the last few pages, were Bryson says: &quot;I sat trapped.. listening to my idly prattling mind and wished that I could just get up and walk out on myself&quot;?  One  realizes that throughout the book, Bryson has never genuinely interacted with the people on his trip. He sees the characters he meets as pawns for his cultural comments and one-liners. He travels with the air of superiority that is a legacy of the Baedecker days where &quot;foreigners&quot; (i.e. the locals) are reduced to servents and characters in a play. The country and culture becomes a stage, all performed for the sojourner's benefit where the entrance fee  is reserved seat on a train purchased by AmEx. I enjoyed the book, but Bryson's open embrace for this form of whirlwind-travel leaves it a bit empty in the end.	1997-07-14

I've loved Eddings' writing for years, so I greeted the arrival of this book with utter glee. It certainly didn't disappoint, either.  It rehashed some parts, yes.  But these parts were either so exciting I didn't mind, went into greater detail, or showed events from a whole new perspective ( Belgarath's slightly amoral but funny view, as opposed to Polgara's outraged understanding of events, or more often, Garion's befuddled and innocent take.)  I understood, for the first time, the origins of beliefs, traditions, and anger-filled rivalries in this wonderful universe of David Eddings.

Constructed of eleven independent sections or &quot;chapters&quot; (the half-chapter is one of the most thought provoking essays I have ever read), the book defies classification--it is not a novel with a characters functioning in a linear plot, yet the repeated motifs and themes that link the work make it much more than a collection of short stories.  Through this method Barnes subverts the conventions we use to characterize literature while brilliantly tweaking the noses of religion and love.  In the process the reader must confront both highly personal and academic questions.  An excellent example of post-modernism done right.<br /><br />Is it a good read?  For the most part yes.  The first two stories, of a termite that sneaks aboard Noah's Ark and of terrorists that sneak aboard a luxury liner, are brilliant.  Some of the &quot;chapters&quot;, though, never manage to get going despite their promise. Thankfully &quot;A History&quot; closes as well, if not better, than it opens; the essay &quot;Parenthesis&quot; anchors the work while giving it its soul and &quot;The Dream&quot; gives born-again Christians (and Hitler) the heaven they deserve.<br /><br /> Also of note is the elan with which Barnes throws off styles, at one minute telling a story with an expert journalistic style, the next mastering the epistolary form.  Barnes shows himself to be a virtuoso with rare insight and skill.	1997-07-14

'Contact' is one of those rare gems which educate,  entertain, postulate, and theorize, taking you along for the ride.  It belongs to a genre that I have begun calling &quot;Science Faction&quot; - science fiction stories that are too real and almost possible; stories that could be plucked from the newspaper headlines of tomorrow or next week;  authors like Michael Chrichton.<br />     'Contact' is about discovering a radio message from space and its effect on humanity.  The science is thick but generally explained.  Science and religion are played against each other, not as enemies attempting to destroy each other, but as opposite sides of the same coin and possibly not as different as people might think.  It is a story of journey and discovery, of answering one of our most sought-after questions - 'Are we alone?' - and what happens when we are faced with the possibility of an answer - do we believe enough in ourselves to accept the answer, to respond to it, and to not fear the unknown?	1997-07-14

I think it's a great story and a fascinating perspective. I have to agree, however,  with the lone reviewer who criticizes the writing. I found the character development very erratic, as if Bradley suddenly tires of a character and decides to move on to someone else. Other than Morgaine, most of the characters do not evolve, although some of them  suddenly veer off into an entirely new personality with no little or no explanation at all. (Igraine and Kevin, for instance). Gueneviere, who is throughly detestable, displays occasional, but inexplicable, flashes of humanity, only to instantly revert to her standard sullen peeveishness. Characters commit the most egregious affronts to one another, then appear as old friends at the next feast. Expectations are not met - we are set up to anticipate plot deveolpments which never occur, and there are several contradictions and inplausibilities which I found annoying. I thought that the end of the book was hurried through while Bradley tried to cram in the rest of the Arthurian legend ( and every character ever remotely associated with it). That may be part of the problem with this book - she had too much material to fit in. Still, she had a great idea here and I wish she had taken more time to develop it.  I thought she was at her best when writing about the 'old faith' and she did a admirable job weaving that spell and making you feel the emotions of it. This could have been a great book rather than a good read. I'll still take T.H. White or Mary Stewart for my dose of the Matter of Britain	1997-07-15

The writer's attempts to flesh out the characters' personalities fall flat, swinging wildly from important details of the character's motivation to an intrusion to the storyline.

It is a mystery book that you can't put down after you begin the first page. The only place he didn't include was the ferry to Block Island. I hope rewrites a sequel to this one.

Even a mediocre Clarke book, which this is, contains far moreentertainment material than the average book.  It also contains morescience and thought-provoking ideas than the average science fiction novel.  That being said, it is unfortunate that this conclusion to the Odyssey isn't more exciting. Clarke never handled dialogue very well, and one exchange goes on for over two pages without identifying who is saying what.  If your characters have different speech cadences this isn't a problem, but as others have noted, his characters all sound alike to our ears. I enjoyed Clarke's speculations as to how far science would advance (and also where it would find limitations).  Paradoxically, even though I wasn't sure where the story was going, I was never really surprised when it got there! Summary: an enjoyable treat, more like reading a letter from an old friend than an exciting, twisting novel.  We know how he writes, we know his shortcomings, but it is still with a smile that we receive his latest work.	1997-07-17

NOT because of his intelligence.  But because  physically no 6-11 yr. old is capable of doing  the things in the book.  He's really more like  10 years older than he's supposed to be.  Even at age 25, I found it hard to believe in  Ender as a governor of a colony.  (Ironically, after a book worth of Ender as  as a youthful child, the next book makes him  practically immortal.)  Also I couldn't stand the Mormon subtext that  Card puts in the book (you've got to look VERY  close to see the sexism and the elitism).  Also, the language bothered me and prevented  me from giving this book to my child. (How many  times must Card use the word &quot;bastard&quot;???)  And some of the violence is very unnecessary.  I would have liked to re-edit this book for  Card yet another time and clean up all the flaws.  Also, the demise of Peter was oh so convenient.  And I always felt Peter was misunderstood.  Furthermore, the re-appearance of Mazar was so  very perdictable.  One more re-write and this  book will rate a 10.	1997-07-18

Ehh, go fig).  What he did was buy me the video.  Ballabing ballaboom, I was hooked. THE movie, for me.  Friends had nightmares and were forever forbidden going over to my house cause I had watched it with them.  I was a lonely kid--in love.  <br />  I read the book a few years later.  Ballabing balla--well, you get the idea.  It's a good way to go, though.  <br />  (PLUG.  It's a rotten thing to advertise a book while reviewing another, but everyone knows &quot;Watership Down&quot;.

I have found that it lives up to this claim excellently. Like Brook's classic &quot;The Mythical Man-Month&quot; Code Complete offers practical advice on the real-world challenges of software development.  Code Complete contains 33 chapters, which can be read as separate essays.<br />  To entry-level programmers and computer science students, this book is an excellent primer on the fundamentals of the industry. For experienced programmers, this book is an great way to review your own development strategies and best practices. For project managers, Code Complete serves as a great source of ideas for process improvement, as well as a great learning tool to pass on to new entry-level hires. My employer has used several chapters out of Code Complete as the basis for discussion topics.<br />   McConnell writes in an easy-to-read, entertaining style that has made him one of the most popular authors in the field.  His book &quot;Rapid Development&quot;, is also an extremely popular book on software development, and many (including me) are anxiously awaiting his next work, &quot;Software Project Survivial Guide&quot;.<br />In short, Code Complete belongs in the library of every serious developer	1997-07-18

The chronicle of Slavomir Rawicz, a Polish cavalry officer who escaped a Soviet Siberian forced labor camp in 1941 and completed an incredible yearlong journey on foot through China, the Gobi Desert and into India is also a testament to human survival and a comforting reminder that human decency still remains in our too-often cruel world. <br /> The book's greatest strength lies in Rawicz's ability to mentally detach himself from his experience and recount in great detail and with notable insight events ranging from the horror of his last cavalry charge against the Germans and subsequent Soviet captivity to picturesque descriptions of Mongol social customs and snowy Himalayan peaks. It is a unique blend of high drama and intrigue, anthropological commentary and how-to wilderness survival paced by a steady, no-nonsense narrative. <br /> The overwhelming irony of this cavalryman's odyssey was that despite the presence of a raging global war fast becoming notorious for mass ethnic extermination, he received nothing but kindness and generosity from all of the native peoples he encountered on his trek.

Frank McCourt is a story teller in the truest sense of the Celtic meaning of story telling; he involves the heart and the intellect. His descriptions of poverty and deprivation will tear you asunder, but leave you alive with understanding. His expression of the true, morbid reality of hunger and the behavior it motivates are intertwined with a child's blind love of his family. Frank McCourt's tale is emotive and real; no romance here, only the hard realities of survival. At points, the store drags on, but with a purpose. He ensures that the reader understands the human heart. An excellent, historically accurate story of one families supreme effort to survive in a country dominated by another's power. Oh!

Adolf Hitler was one of the most loved and hated men of the20th Century.

The author goes into detail on policy questions which will later be realized just before and during the Second World War.  The book is said to be very prophetic in that sense.

This is not science fiction in the traditional sence as much as it is a sort of a science novel, in the safe vein as Gregory Benford's _Timescape_ (which I enjoyed more than _Contact_). The other major problem with this work is that Sagan's forte is as a nonfiction writer and not as a novelist. So at times _Contact_ shrugs under the weight of too much wordless narration without dialogue. Many of his ideas are interesting but feel out of place in the novel, thrown in to boost the page count. Nevertheless, it's worth reading if you're a Carl Sagan fan or a fan of science fiction, but don't expect incredibly wonderful Arthur C. Clarke-esque things. There are better &quot;first contact&quot; novels out there, like Clarke's _Rendevous with Rama_ or _2001_ to name two of the best.I don't intend to see the movie, since a _lot_ of things from the book appear to have been changed	1997-07-22

I recommend this compilation of Morrison's prose for those interested in poetry, literature, or The Doors.  To hear any author recite his or her own work is an experience revealing their deepest desires and passions.  The opportunity to hear the expressions of Jim Morrison as told by himself combined with the background music of The Doors, makes An American Prayer a journey of the mind through the eyes of one of the greatest poets of the century.

Relations amoung the boys were now stretched to the breaking point.  But John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Richard Starkey would not let it end until they released a final masterpiece; a final farewell to their fans across the world. The result was the epic &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, one of the finest rock ablums ever.  This album would see George Harrison come of age as a songwriter with the unforgetable &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;.  Ringo's &quot;Octopus's Garden&quot; would become his signature song (McCartney actually wrote &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;).  John would continue the avante garde with &quot;I Want You (She's So Heavy)&quot; and &quot;Because&quot;, and Paul would end the Beatles era with some words to remember with &quot;The End&quot;.  &quot;Abbey Road&quot; was a perfect sendoff.  The four of them would never record together again.  But with &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, the world will forever remember the greatness of the Beatles. END	1997-07-23

The only reason I would classify this book as a 9 and not a 10 is due to the lack of verifiable confirmation by other authorities.      Colonel Phillip J. Corso can be verified as being an aide to President Dwight D. Eisenhower on the internet.  The only difference being the spelling of the first name Phillip vs Philip.      If Col. Corso is the legitimate author and has not made up a work of fiction by interweaving fact and fiction, then this is probably the most heroic thing that an individual could do.       I would consider Col. Corso a great patriot that will almost certainly give the US Government back to the people.  The USA citizens should not tolerate a secret government.  Even if was necessary to protect the citizens until an answer was understood, Colonel Corso indicates that the alien threat is at least blunted.  He even intimates that the world now has global protection and other world threats are at least under control and the world is protected.      If the book only had endorsements or reliable witness testimony then perhaps we can believe that the Roswell Incident did occur and aliens did crash land on our planet.       It is high time other reliable witnesses reveal their part in the cover up and help all of the pieces of the puzzle to be put together.  Then maybe Major Jesse Marcel and other first hand witnesses can rest in peace, especially William &quot;Mac&quot; Brazel.	1997-07-23

Before making &quot;Please Please Me&quot; in 1963, the band recorded some songs with singer Tony Sheridan, and laid down a few tracks during an audition at Decca.  Following their first single, &quot;Love Me Do&quot;, this record would showcase the Beatles performance repetoire at this time. It features many of the songs the band played to their growing throng of fans throughout Liverpool.  With gems like &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot;, &quot;Love Me Do&quot;, and &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, we begin to see how the Lennon-McCartney song writting team would become great.  In addition to these Beatles originals, we are treated to several covers like &quot;Anna (Go With Him)&quot; and &quot;Baby, It's You&quot;, as well as an unbelievable performance of &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; by John Lennon.  &quot;Please Please Me&quot; is wonderful rock and roll and fluffy pop.

The concept: forget all the fancy sound loops and double-tracking that made records like Sgt. Pepper so unforgetable.  Forget the over-dubs.  This recording was the Beatles raw; mistakes and all.  Quite simply, what &quot;Let It Be&quot; tries to capture is the essence of the Beatles of the past; The boys sitting around jaming in the studio before all the screaming girls, before the death threats, before the mania. The recording accomplishes this at times.  &quot;Let It Be&quot; has some fantastic moments.  Classics like &quot;Get Back&quot;, &quot;Let It Be&quot;, and &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; are simply marvelous.  And we get to hear some older Beatles tunes (&quot;One After 909&quot; from 1963 and &quot;Across the Universe&quot; from 1967), never previously recorded until now.  But there are a few problems with this record.  The record was produced by Phil Spector who over-produced a few numbers, and did some poor edting at times.  &quot;Dig It&quot;, a fabulous John Lennon rocker is edited to a few measly seconds, and an old Liverpool folk song called &quot;Maggie Mae&quot; gets tracked despite breaking down in the middle.  But the essence of the Beatles shines through.  Regardless of what you think about Spector's producing, &quot;Let It Be&quot; is a sold performance.  The fab four were breaking up by this time, and yet the music remained as great as ever. END	1997-07-23

These two albums would sit at #1 and #2 for weeks to come.  &quot;With the Beatles&quot; starts with a bang.  From the first few bars of &quot;It Won't Be Long&quot;, we are treated to a rock and roll feast from the mop tops.  Some fantastic songs highlight this record.

Lennon's song writing soars with gems like &quot;Little Child&quot; and &quot;All I've Go to Do&quot;.  George Harrison gets his first credit with a swift little rocker called &quot;Don't Bother Me&quot;, and Lennon ends the album with his scortching version of &quot;Money&quot; in much the same fasion as he ended &quot;Please Please Me&quot; with &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;.  &quot;With The Beatles&quot; is grittier than &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, and therefor, better.

Beatlemania had reached a frenzied pitch by this point, and the boys spent  more time in airports and hotel rooms than in the studio making more music.  As a result, &quot;Beatles For Sale&quot; would be a bit disappointing when compared to it's predecessor &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot;.  The fabs were doing covers again.  They probably didn't have the time to write enough quality originals for this album.  Even so, some of these originals are instant classics.  &quot;I'm a Loser&quot;, &quot;Baby's in Black&quot;, and &quot;No Reply&quot; are some of the memorable tunes from this record.  Most pop bands would be thrilled with this sort of output.  But the Beatles weren't like most bands.  This band was capalbe of greatness.

It was their first LP to feature only Lennon-McCartney originals.  The result is unforgetable.  This record is the best of the &quot;early&quot; Beatles recordings.  By 1964, Lennon and McCartney had moved beyond the level of being &quot;good&quot; song writters.  Now, they were becoming &quot;great&quot;.  Lennon's gorgeous &quot;If I Fell&quot;, McCartney's energetic &quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot;, and knock out performances of &quot;I Should Have Known Better,&quot; &quot;I'll Be Back&quot;, and &quot;When I Get Home&quot; are just some of the highlights of this recording.  Truly, &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; is the crowning achievment of the Beatles early days.  It shows a tremendous advancement in songwriting, and points the way toward the Beatles of the years to come. END	1997-07-24

While the title character struggles through what he believes to be questions of his occupation, he indeeds, in my opinion, touches on many subjects that are more universal.  What is dignity?  What is honor?  What  is that intrinsic quality to which we refer to as character?

The development of the plot is senseless, and themain character, Dr. Kay Scarpetta, has become self-absorbed and implausible.  For example, she continues to nag Marino about his poor personal health habits, but proceeds to walk unprotected into a house where a woman has died of a deadly virus which Scarpetta suspects is the same as the pox virus she had found in a torso she had just autopsied.  How smart is that? <br /> In another scene, Scarpetta has Marino come to her house in the middle of the night to see an alarming e-mail message she had received.  The good doctor comes completely unglued when Marino moves a file and sits in her chair at the computer to view the message.  Is this supposed to make us think that Dr. Scarpetta is a tough-as-nails, her-own-woman kind of gal? <br /> It makes no sense that Dr. Scarpetta is exposed to the virus, unprotected, on three separate occasions and never comes down with it. Others do.  It can't be because Dr. Scarpetta has such a strong immune system.she does come down with the flu during this time, but apparently is immune to the deadly pox virus.  Right! <br /> Maybe Dr. Scarpetta should look into early retirement options.	1997-07-26
