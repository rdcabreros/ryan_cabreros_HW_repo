I practiced on using durable terminal workflows with tmux, searching the filesystem with find and globbing, filtering with grep and regex, and using pipelines.
 I also leanred how to work with file and folder permissions, creating hard and symbolic links, which are shown in a cool manner in my opinon,
 I created a 10000 row random sample of the reviews dataset and used it for filtering and analysis.
 After that, I built the star rating histograms, extracted the top products, and compared subsets of the product IDs.
 I also created directoreis for IDS with customer and product star ratings.
 Some pitfalls I ran into was remembering the corect column numbers and making sure that the outputs were appended to the report files properly.
 I learned that redirection and tee commands are very useful for creating reproducible artifacts.
 Overall I feel more confident using the command line to process data efficiently.
